<h2 align="center">RESPECTING THE DIGNITY OF OTHERS</h2><br>

	<p><i>The Chrysler organization built a special car for Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who could not use a
standard car because his legs were paralyzed. W. F. Chamberlain and a mechanic delivered it to the
White House. I have in front of me a letter from Mr. Chamberlain relating his experiences.</i></p>
<p><i>“I taught President Roosevelt how to handle a car with a lot of unusual gadgets, but he taught me a
lot about the fine art of handling people. When I called at the White House,” Mr. Chamberlain writes,
“the president was extremely pleasant and cheerful. He called me by name, made me feel very
comfortable, and particularly impressed me with the fact that he was vitally interested in things I had
to show him and tell him.</i></p>
<p><i>“The car was so designed that it could be operated entirely by hand. A crowd gathered around to look
at the car, and he remarked, 7 think it is marvelous. All you have to do is to touch a button, and it
moves away, and you can drive it without effort. I think it's grand. I don't know what makes it go. I'd
love to have time to tear it down and see how it works.'</i></p>
<p><i>“When Roosevelt's friends and associates admired the machine, he said in their presence, ‘Mr.
Chamberlain, I certainly appreciate all the time and effort you have spent in developing this car. It is a
mighty fine job’ He admired the radiator, the special rear-vision mirror and clock, the special
spotlight, the kind of upholstery, the sitting position of the driver's seat, the special suitcases in the
trunk with his monogram on each suitcase. In other words, he took notice of every detail to which he
knew I had given considerable thought. He made a point of bringing these various pieces of equipment
to the attention of Mrs. Roosevelt, Miss Perkins, the secretary of labor, and his secretary. He even
brought the old White House porter into the picture by saying, ‘George, you want to take particularly
good care of the suitcases.'</i></p>
<p><i>“When the driving lesson was finished, the president turned to me and said: ‘Well, Mr. Chamberlain,
I've been keeping the Federal Reserve Board waiting thirty minutes. I guess I had better get back to
work.'”</i><b>—DALE CARNEGIE</b></p>
<p>Don Monti was sixteen years old when his family received the devastating news: Don had
leukemia and, the doctors guessed, about two weeks to live.</p>
<p>“We were in Don's room at the hospital,” recalls his mother, Tita Monti. “This was right after he
was diagnosed. We were very careful not to let him know that he had a fatal disease. We told Dr.
Degnan not to say anything. We told the desk. We kept this pretense going.”</p>
<p>That night Don's parents decided to ignore about fifteen of the hospital's rules and prepared
their son a home-cooked meal right in his room. “He loved fettuccine Alfredo,” his mother recalls.
“We shut the door. We had this little can of Sterno. We were cooking fettuccine Alfredo for him.
We hear a knock at the door and in walks Tom Degnan. I held my breath. I thought, ‘Oh God, what
is he going to say?’ This is all foreign to me.</p>
<p>“Dr. Degnan looks and says, ‘That's my favorite dish.’ He sat down and we served him. We never
had the feeling, ‘Well, he's the doctor and we're the patients.'”</p>
<p>There were any number of things Dr. Degnan could have said when he walked into Don Monti's
room. He could have said, “Didn't anyone tell you about hospital rules?”</p>
<p>He could have said, “Why are you cooking in the room?” He could have said, “Fettuccine Alfredo
is definitely not on the hospital meal plan.”</p>
<p>But Degnan had respect for the personal dignity of his patient and the patient's family. He never
pulled rank once. He just sat down beside them and treated the Montis like human beings. The
only way to form trusting relationships is to respect the dignity of others.</p>
<p>Burt Manning, the chairman of J. Walter Thompson Company, the giant Madison Avenue
advertising firm, was invited not long ago to speak before an audience of young copywriters. These
men and women, most in their twenties and early thirties, were just starting out in this highly
competitive, often cutthroat business, so they were eager to learn a few tricks from an ad-world
legend like Manning, who had lasted at the top for as long as many of them had been alive.</p>
<p>“Brains and talent and energy are merely the entry fee for the race,” Manning told his brighteyed
audience that day. “You can't even get in without them.”</p>
<p>But those talents aren't enough, not by a long shot. “To win, you need more,” he said. “To win,
you have to know the secret and live by it. It's that simple. What is this magical secret? It's this: Do
unto others as you would have them do unto you.”</p>
<p>That's right, the Golden Rule, right in the middle of Madison Avenue. Manning's reasoning did
not hinge on religion, ethics, self-satisfaction, or the difference between right and wrong, although
he told the young copywriters that those are all fine reasons for following his advice. But he gave
them another one too: the Golden Rule delivers.</p>
<p>“Even if you are the least altruistic person in the world, even if you are purely devoted to your
own self-interest, money, prestige, promotions,” the veteran ad man said, “the surest way to get it
all is to follow unswervingly the Golden Rule.”</p>

<p>The president of the corporation, the teacher in the classroom, the clerk at the supermarket—
they will all do better, go further, accomplish more, and feel better about themselves if they can
just master that one simple, time-honored rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto
you. Or stated in a more modern fashion, show respect for others. They will show respect for you.</p>
<p>The world today is not just an old boys’ club. It is a vastly more integrated, more diverse place
than it was even a generation ago. Nowhere is that diversity more apparent than in the business
world. Women, gays, people with disabilities, people from a wide array of racial and ethnic
backgrounds—they're all a part of the equation today.</p>
<p>To succeed in that changed environment, it is absolutely essential to get along comfortably with
everyone, whatever their background or culture may be. “Only fifteen or twenty percent of the
people entering the work force in the twenty-first century are not going to be minorities, women,
or immigrants,” predicts James Houghton, chairman of Corning, Incorporated. “I mean, we're there.
So unless you want to avail yourself of only fifteen percent of the talent out there, you'd better get
diverse real quick.”</p>
<p>The best way to begin respecting another culture—or anything else, for that matter—is to learn
about it. That was one of the main things that drew die late Arthur Ashe to professional tennis. “I
knew there was a lot of travel involved,” he said. “That is really what I looked forward to. I wanted
to go to those places. I wanted to see those things I'd only read about in the pages of National
Geographic. I welcomed the opportunity to get to know them.</p>
<p>“Looking back on it now,” Ashe said in an interview just before his death, “I rank that as one of
my greatest sustained sets of recollections, the interactions I've had with a very wide variety of
people from a lot of different cultures.</p>
<p>“You can look at traveling two ways,” Ashe said. “You can have a very haughty attitude about
your own culture. You go to other places and look condescendingly down at people who have come
from civilizations many thousands of years older than yours. Maybe they're not as technologically
advanced, and you think our system is better. The other way to look at it is to say, ‘Yes, their
physical condition and circumstances are not good. But boy, what a rich theological or a rich
cultural heritage they have. They've been here ten thousand years, so they must know something.
We've only been around two hundred years.’ I much prefer the second approach.”</p>
<p>Even nations that are next-door neighbors often view each other differently. These differences
must be recognized, respected, and never condescended to. That's what Helmut Krings discovered
moving back and forth between Germany and Switzerland. Krings, a German, is vice president for
Central Europe at Sun Microsystems, a leading workstation manufacturer.</p>
<p>“I avoid comparisons,” he says. “I try to avoid making any reference to Germany. What people
hate most is if you are constantly saying what you do at home is right and suggesting that they're
not doing things properly in their country.”</p>
<p>All people want respect for their own culture and language. It's only natural. Melchior Wathelet,
the deputy prime minister of Belgium, grew up in a French-speaking Belgian family. Early in his
political career, Wathelet decided to bridge his nation's language gap by learning to speak Flemish,
the other official language. This made him Belgium's first French-Belgian politician to become fluent
in both national languages. He showed his respect for all the nation's people. He became a national
symbol of unity, and his political career soared. He had learned to live with diversity.</p>

<p>So how do you live comfortably with diversity in the corporate boardroom, in the university, in
the local sales office, in the nonprofit organization, in the government today? The first step is a
basic one: Put yourself in the other person's place. Other people are living, breathing human beings
just like you are. They have pressures at home. They want to succeed. They want to be treated with
the same dignity, respect, and understanding that you do. What's important, says Thomas A.
Doherty, the chairman of Fleet Bank, “is the way in which people are treated on a daily basis.
People want to be treated and recognized as individuals. That was true when I first came into
banking thirty years ago, and I think one hundred years from now it's still going to be true.” And
Doherty is clear about the reason: “Because we're all human beings.”</p>
<p>What matters, says Doherty, is “treating people with respect. Small things like ‘Good morning’
and ‘Thank you.’ My own feeling is that it's the role of management to create an atmosphere where
people can perform at their highest level.” That atmosphere exists where people feel they're being
respected and treated like individuals. It's absent where people feel they're just a number.</p>
<p>Most successful people have learned over the years that making others feel important is seldom
accomplished by a single or even a few grand gestures. It's a process made up of many little
touches.</p>
<p>Adriana Bitter at Scalamandre Silks has seen the power of this reality. Times were tough for the
fabric industry in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but the company survived by pulling together with
the employees. “Our people have been incredibly wonderful, working with us to get through this,”
explains Bitter. “I mean they've been fantastic and I think it comes back to closeness. If we didn't
have this closeness, why should they give anything back to us? You know you have to give to
someone if you're going to get back. Anyway, that's our philosophy.”</p>
<p>How do you create that closeness? By showing respect and compassion and dignity to the people
who work with you, by acknowledging that they're human beings who exist outside the work
environment. At Bitter's company, that meant having the second-in-command gently correct a
visiting speaker when he referred to the employees as mill workers instead of artisans. It meant
Bitter's walking through the mill and talking to one of the designers about overcoming his fear of
flying so he could take a planned vacation. It meant leaving the door to the president's office open
and welcoming a bare-chested artisan when he needed to talk about problems in the dye house. It
meant learning to peak Spanish to communicate better with the crew.</p>
<p>Fred Sievert of New York Life is in a very different Industry, but he knows some rules are the
same. The little touches are everything in insurance too. In the insurance industry, the agents are
the company. If the agents don't sell, pretty soon there is no company. It's that simple.</p>
<p>Years ago Sievert was working for Maccabee, the international insurance firm. When the
company moved into a new office building that housed several other companies, Sievert wanted to
be sure that the important personal touches didn't get lost in the shuffle. So his first stop at the
new building was at the security desk. “I rounded up the people who worked at security, ten or
twelve of them,” Sievert remembers. “They didn't even know we were in the insurance business,
other than the name of the company. I said, ‘Hey, we've got some key agents in Detroit, and if you
know that a person coming in here is an agent, I mean roll out the red carpet. Do whatever you
have to. If you've got to walk the visitor up to the seventh floor to find the right person, do it.’ I
later got great feedback from some agents about the way they were treated when they walked in
the building.”</p>
<p>All these little touches add up to one very big whole: people feeling good about themselves.
People who believe their organization cares about them and understands their needs are the
people who are likely to respond by working hard and trying to advance the organization's goals.</p>
<p>Dale Carnegie used to tell the story of Jim Farley, Franklin Delano Roosevelt's campaign manager.
Farley made it his business to remember —and use —the names of everyone he came into contact
with. Often this meant remembering literally thousands of names. While running Roosevelt's
reelection campaign, Farley would travel by boat, train, and automobile, hopping from town to
town, meeting hundreds of people at each stop. When he returned home after weeks on the road,
he was exhausted. But he didn't rest before he had completed one task he considered absolutely
essential: he'd send a personally signed letter to all the people he'd met on the campaign trail. And
he'd start each letter with the person's first name: Dear Bill or Dear Rita.</p>
<p>Do people today still respond to those small things? You bet they do. Returning a phone call,
remembering a name, treating someone respectfully—those are just about the most important
things any leader can do. These basics, says ad man Burt Manning, “are what works. That's how
people separate themselves from the crowd, from the masses, by doing these basic things and
never stopping.”</p>
<p>On a recent trip to Manning's office, a visitor was struck by a small gesture. There was only one
hanger in the office. Manning took the visitor's coat and hung it on the hanger. He tossed his own
coat over a doorknob. Trivial? Maybe, but don't think it wasn't noticed. Those are the little touches
that send a message: “I care about you. Your concerns are my concerns. We are in this together.” A
real positive environment can be created that way.</p>

<p>And there is no better way of reinforcing it than by following the second step to the Golden
Rule: Treat employees like colleagues, and don't condescend, dictate, or berate. They are your
coworkers, after all, not your servants or your best friends. So treat them accordingly. Recognize
the humanity that everyone in the organization shares. Playing the big boss doesn't motivate
people to do anything but resent the individual who's pulling rank.</p>
<p>Given the great power of respect, why do so many managers fall into the habit of demeaning
and yelling at the people who work for them? Often the reason is low self-esteem. “Managers are
exposed,” says John B. Robinson, Jr., executive vice president of Fleet Financial Group Inc., Fleet
Bank's parent. “They're on the line. I've often seen people—because it's a difficult situation—adopt
an unnatural style. I'm thinking of some people I've seen over the years who tried to be tough
managers and yet they aren't really tough managers. It's a cover maybe because of their own
discomfort.” Does it work? Almost never. “They tend to abuse people verbally and try to demand
respect by ordering people around or by being arbitrary or that sort of thing,” Robinson explains,
“and that's usually exactly counterproductive.” The reason is simple: people rarely respond well to
intimidation.</p>
<p>It's much more effective to let your employees see that you are a human being too. Treat people
like equals, like valuable assets, not like another piece of the company's machinery. What has to be
done, says Bill Makahilabila of SGS-Thomson Microelectronics, Inc., is “to strip ourselves from
position, strip ourselves from title in terms of how we viewed it in the past. View it as everyone
contributing.”</p>
<p>For some business leaders this means a whole new understanding of the relationship between
employee and boss. The right tone must be set for respect and open communication to occur. John
Robinson believes, “I guess one of the things that you need to do is maintain a sense of humility.
It's so easy in the corporate world, the higher we get, to really believe that we're as important as
our title suggests or that we're as smart as our position says.” Years ago Robinson found a great
way to remind himself that, despite the fancy titles he has had, he's just like everyone else he
works with. “I was the president of a bank when I was in my early thirties, and I'd feel very
important about that,” he recalls. “Then I'd come home and the baby would be wet and miserable,
and I'd be changing the baby's diaper. Immediately it brought me back and gave me perspective.
My kids are really what kept me in balance.”</p>
<p>Put yourself in the other person's place. Don't condescend. Those are both important. The third
step to the Golden Rule: Engage people. Challenge them. Invite their input. Encourage their
cooperation.</p>
<p>Work, in most cases, is as big a part of their lives as it is of yours. Almost certainly they want to
be involved. They want to be engaged. They want to be challenged and stretched. They don't want
their opinions ignored.</p>
<p>People who are passionate and involved with what they do will do it well. As Ray Stata of Analog
Devices Inc. puts it, “What people want is a feeling of importance, a feeling of impact, a feeling of
influence.”</p>
<p>How can this feeling be created? By empowering your employees, challenging them, involving
them in the planning of your organization. Says Stata, “I think that the most important thing is that
people have job assignments and tasks to do that they feel are commensurate with their ability or
maybe stretch them somewhat beyond their ability. I think the most important part of motivation
is to try to link the task to the individual in such a way that it is a real challenge, that there is a
stretch of expectation.”</p>
<p>Rubbermaid figured this out early. That company radically pioneered the employee
empowerment method of management. When Rubbermaid had to design a multimillion-dollar
piece of new equipment in the late 1980s, the bosses didn't rule the day. Instead Rubbermaid had
the employees, the people who actually would be using the machine, lead the process. Wolfgang
Schmitt explains, “We put together a team of six people. These were all production associates with
one management associate. They went out to the various companies who make these kinds of
equipment and did the benchmarking. They were the ones who made the recommendation on
what to buy. They were the ones who went over and trained in Europe, in this case in Germany, on
the machines. They came back with the supplier's people and set it up. They managed it. They
scheduled it. They ensured the quality of it. They did the preventive maintenance.”</p>
<p>The results of this approach for Rubbermaid have been profound. The company has one of the
highest employee-retention rates in the business, and Rubbermaid employees work. From 1982 to
1992 Rubbermaid paid an average annual rate of return to investors of 25.7 percent.</p>
<p>Bill Makahilahila describes the process of empowering his employees as one of his most
important roles. It's often a difficult one. It involves instilling a sense of confidence in employees,
“helping employees process their own thoughts and their own ideas and then solidifying that in
their minds so they can feel self-confident in carrying out and executing their skills,” as
Makahilahila puts it. It involves hanging back, supporting the decisions, not taking over.</p>
<p>“In my mind there is no such thing as a right or wrong decision,” he says. “I need to give you the
full authority to make the decision. Now, if it's not the best decision that has been made, we'll
discuss it. But if it is the best decision, I'll reinforce it to you and help you recognize it.”</p>
<p>It's difficult, but the results justify the effort. Employees become committed to what they're
doing. Perhaps Ray Stata says it best: “I think the pinnacle of what's important, particularly for
educated, professional, knowledgeable workers, is the whole issue of self-actualization, selffulfillment.
So the notion of continuing improvement and growth in the development of their
capabilities is at the end of the day the most important thing to motivate people.”</p>
<p>Treat people well, treat them like equals, and engage them in the team process of work. There is
one final way to create the workplace of dignity: Humanize the organization in ways big and small.</p>
<p>Symbolic efforts can play a big role here. For instance, get out from behind that big executive
desk. Joyce Harvey of Harmon Associates Corporation has a small conference table in her office,
and she uses it. “We sit around and talk,” Harvey says. “I very often have a midday meeting, and I
always make it a habit to bring lunch for any employee who's staying through the lunch hour. It
makes it more casual and more informal, and it shows that we care and respect their time.”</p>
<p>E. Martin Gibson, chairman of Corning Lab Services Inc., moves beyond symbolism. He thinks that
humanizing an organization is so important that he's even structured the physical plants of his
facilities with that in mind. “I think employees working in a single location with ten, fifteen, twenty
thousand people is a disaster,” says Gibson. “I mean I can't imagine myself getting out of the car
and walking through a parking lot with ten thousand people in a huge complex. I would always ask
myself the question, ‘If I vaporized, would anyone even know it?’ Chances are no. Or all they would
say is, ‘Where's old what's-his-name?’”</p>
<p>A worker who feels this disassociated isn't going to be very committed to an organization.
Corning Lab Services, knowing this, has come up with a solution. The company has thirty-two
different physical locations. While one of them is large—nineteen hundred employees—the rest
range between three hundred and six hundred employees.</p>
<p>The results? “We've got people who, when they go to work every morning, know each other's
names,” said Gibson. “If they vaporized, someone would know. You know people would miss you
because you're working in a small unit. Everyone knows your first name. It's exciting.” Wolfgang
Schmitt of Rubbermaid agrees. That's why he tries to keep his facilities in the four-to-six-hundredemployee
range. Why that size? To save money? Not really. “What we think is really crucial is the
people relationships,” explains Schmitt. “When you get beyond the four- to six-hundred number,
we think the personalized aspect of that relationship, the understanding, the empathy goes away.
You start having to layer in overhead to artificially create understanding rather than having it sort
of organically present. So both from a humanistic viewpoint and from a pure cost viewpoint, it's
just as prudent, really smart, to stay in these units that are about that size.”</p>
<p>Schmitt reached that conclusion when interviews with employees revealed that that size pleased
the employees. “We find that the more we stick with that mode, the more people feel good about
being a part of the organization, the more connectedness there is.”</p>
<p>These issues are vitally important, and they aren't just for top managers. All of us—at whatever
position —will go further and accomplish more by respecting the importance and the dignity of
others, whatever their position, background, or relationship to us.</p>
<p>This is not a new concept. Years ago Dale Carnegie was applying it to people all over the world.
“Do you feel that you are superior to the Japanese?” Carnegie asked. “The truth is that the
Japanese consider themselves far superior to you. Do you consider yourselves superior to the
Hindus in India? That is your privilege. But a million Hindus feel infinitely superior to you.</p>
<p>“Each nation feels superior to other nations. That breeds patriotism and wars.</p>
