		<h2 align="center">MOTIVATING PEOPLE</h2><br>


	<p><i>Even as a boy Andrew Carnegie discovered the astonishing importance that people place on their
names. When he was ten years old, he had a father rabbit and a mother rabbit. He awoke one
morning to discover that he had a whole nest full of little rabbits and nothing to feed them.</i></p>
<p><i>What do you suppose he did? Well, he had a brilliant idea. He told half a dozen boys in the
neighborhood that if they would go out every day and pull enough dandelions and grass and clover to
feed the rabbits, he would name the rabbits in their honor. The plan worked like magic, and here is
the point of the story.</i></p>
<p><i>Andrew Carnegie never forgot tint incident. And years later, he made millions of dollars by using the
same technique in business. He wanted to sell steel rails to the Pennsylvania Railroad. J. Edgar
Thomson was president of the railroad then. So Andrew Carnegie, remembering the lesson he had
learned from his rabbits, built a huge steel mill in Pittsburgh and called it the J. Edgar Thomson Steel
works.</i></p>
<p><i>Now let me ask you a question. When the Pennsylvania Railroad needed steel rails after that, where
do you suppose J. Edgar Thomson bought them?</i><b>—DALE CARNEGIE</b></p>
<p>Paul Fireman needed a highly motivated work force. Fireman, chairman of Reebok International,
made a promise that was unusually bold. In two years’ time, Fireman vowed, Reebok would
overtake Nike in market share.</p>
<p>Fireman didn't bribe or threaten or cajole the people who worked for him. He led them to
motivation. He showed the employees he was willing to take risks, encouraging them to do the
same. He built an innovative product-development program and funded it generously. He vowed to
spend whatever it took— whatever—to hire the world's top sports figures as Reebok spokespeople.
Fireman talked and lived a new Reebok vision, twenty-four hours a day.</p>
<p>“You need to build an enrollment,” he explains. “I don't think you can dictate that to people. I
don't think you can tell people, ‘Go. March. Do this.’ What you need to do is to take the time to
enroll people in your thinking, your vision, your dream, your fantasy, whatever it is you're doing.
Enroll them. It takes time. It takes effort. It takes continual reinforcement. But you don't dictate.
You enroll.</p>
<p>“If you enroll one person, then you have a metamorphosis. You change someone, and that
person becomes able to enroll ten people. They become able to enroll a hundred people. People
thought that my goal was outrageous. But after the second, third, fifth, tenth, twentieth, and
thirtieth days, they saw that it's not a statement. It's a way of life.</p>
<p>“It's like the old cowboy movies where the hero was going to make the final battle against the
villain and rescue the heroine,” explained Fireman. “As the hero was riding on his white horse, with
one other guy next to him, a person joined in from the right. Then ten more from the left. And they
keep going until finally at the end of the thirty seconds, there are seven hundred people riding,
dust flying, and they're on their way to the final shot.</p>
<p>“You can't wait until you call everybody up and say, ‘Will you join me at River Creek?’ You make
them want to come along. You ride. You go. And you just suck everybody else with you. The music
rises. And you find that when you get there, whether you needed seven hundred or nine hundred,
the point is that you're riding. And they want to ride along.” You've got to make them want to ride
along. It's a leader's job to foster those feelings. “We are in this together.” “We are part of a team.”
“What we do is valuable.” “We're the best.” That is the soil that real motivation grows in.</p>
<p>Sure, everyone wants a paycheck, an end-of-the-year bonus, a stock plan, and a great benefits
package too. But real motivation will never flow from financial inducements alone, or for that
matter, from a fear of being fired. People who work only for a paycheck and not because they like
what they do and or feel inspired to do it well—these people will work only as hard as they have to
in order to get paid. Fear is just as poor a motivator. Companies that are run on that basis will end
up with a work force of resentful employees, just itching to take advantage of the boss.</p>
<p>“There is only one way under heaven to get anybody to do anything,” Dale Carnegie said, “and
that is by making the other person want to do it. Remember, there is no other way.</p>
<p>“Of course,” Carnegie went on, “you can make someone want to give you his watch by sticking a
revolver in his ribs. You can make your employees give you cooperation—until your back is turned
—by threatening to fire them. You can make a child do what you want by a spanking or a threat.
But these crude methods have sharply undesirable repercussions.”</p>
<p>So what do people really want? “Not many things,” Carnegie said. “Health and the preservation
of life. Food. Sleep. Money and the things money will buy. Life in the hereafter. Sexual gratification.
The well-being of our children. A feeling of importance.</p>
<p>“Almost all these wants are usually gratified, all except one. There is one longing—almost as
deep, as imperious as the desire for food or sleep. It is what Freud calls the desire to be great. It is
what Dewey calls the desire to be important.”</p>
<p>Give someone a real sense of purpose, the feeling that he or she is working for a valuable,
mutually important goal. That's where true motivation comes from—motivation not just to go
through the motions of working, motivation to excel.</p>
<p>So recognize people. Include them. Encourage them. Train them. Ask their opinions. Praise them.
Let them make decisions. Share the glory with them. Seek their advice and follow it when you can.
Make them understand how valued they are. Encourage them to take risks. Give them the freedom
to work as they see fit, and convey your belief in their abilities by getting out of the way.</p>

<p>Show people, in other words, that you trust, respect, and care about them. Do that, and you will
be surrounded by motivated people.</p>
<p>As Bill Geppert says, “Take care of your people, and the business takes care of itself.” Geppert is
general manager of Cox Cable, Inc., in New Orleans, a position that makes him responsible for three
hundred employees. One of them is a young technical construction specialist named Brian
Clemons, who works for Cox in suburban Jefferson Parish.</p>
<p>Clemons was on vacation one morning, and he happened to stop in at a Home Depot store to
buy some lumber. While waiting for his lumber to be cut, he overheard a man complaining about
Cox. As the man spoke, eight or nine other Home Depot customers were gathered around, listening
to this tale of cable-television woe.</p>
<p>“Now, Brian could have done a number of things,” Geppert said later, recounting what happened
next. “He was on vacation. He had work to do, and his wife wanted him home. So he could have
just gone about his business, ignoring what was being said. What did Brian do? Brian Clemons
walked right up and said, ‘Sir, I couldn't help but overhear what you were telling these folks. I work
for Cox. Would you please give me an opportunity to make the situation right? In fact, I guarantee
we can take care of your problem.'</p>
<p>“Well, you can imagine the looks on those eight people's faces. They were astonished. Brian, who
wasn't wearing his uniform, walked over to a pay phone, called the office, and dispatched a repair
crew to the house. The repair crew met that customer as he arrived home and took care of the
situation to the customer's satisfaction. In fact, we found out later that Brian even went a step
further. He followed up when he came back to work to make sure that the customer was satisfied
with the result. And he gave the customer two weeks’ credit on his account and an apology for the
inconvenience.”</p>
<p>A rare event? In some organizations, service like that is unheard-of. For employees to take that
kind of responsibility? To get involved in issues that aren't technically their jobs? To “waste” their
own vacation time? Unlikely. But Geppert has been working to make that attitude standard at Cox.
He has helped his employees understand that Cox is their company, and its success will bring their
success. “Now, this may be a blazing flash of common sense,” Geppert says, “but that's the kind of
thing we want people to get involved in and do.”</p>
<p>So how can you force employees to take that kind of interest in their jobs? The answer is, you
can't. People can never be forced to do an extraordinary job. They will perform extraordinarily only
if they want to. The challenge is giving them a reason to want to.</p>
<p>“Action springs out of what we fundamentally desire,” Harry A. Overstreet wrote in his timeless
book, Influencing Human Behavior. “The best piece of advice which can be given to would-be
persuaders, whether in business, in the home, in the school, in politics is: ‘First, arouse in the other
person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a
lonely way.’” Over-street's insight remains true today.</p>
<p>David McDonald, president of Pelco Corporation, a successful security-equipment company on
the West Coast, has done a splendid job of instilling this want-to attitude. He treats his people
with dignity. He communicates corporate values they can believe in. He gives his employees the
autonomy to decide how to get the job done. The results have been extraordinary.</p>
<p>“We have an employee named Bill Reese who works in the sales department,” McDonald says.
“Bill got a call one Friday morning from a customer in Seattle. This fellow was frantic. He thought he
had ordered a special run of security equipment from us months earlier for a real important
installation, I believe for a boating company.</p>
<p>“As he was coming down to the tail end of his installation, he realized he didn't have the Pelco
equipment. He realized he had never ordered it in the first place. The job was supposed to be
completed the next day, Saturday, or he was going to be into a very heavy financial penalty. He
didn't know what to do. We were the only source of this equipment. He called and talked to Bill
fairly early in the morning. This is one of the few products that we actually custom manufacture for
each order. There were none in stock, and they required a specific hammer to be installed inhouse.
Bill took the call and said he'd do the best he could.</p>
<p>“Bill went into our factory and bypassed the whole production-control system; he started a
production job from scratch and got everybody tuned in. I think the quantity of this order was
fifteen. He got the project into high gear through our fabrication department. But then we weren't
going to have the cameras by the time it got to assembly. So he contacted our supplier in Los
Angeles and arranged to have fifteen of these cameras shipped counter to counter from Los
Angeles. He had somebody literally take them to LAX as soon as he hung up the phone. They
arrived a few hours later in Fresno, and he was at the airport to pick them up. Bill picked up the
cameras and got them to assembly just in time to get them installed into these housings that
actually came off the assembly line about fifteen minutes before we had to have them at the
airport.</p>
<p>“Bill had made arrangements with United Airlines to make room on their plane up to San
Francisco for this product so it could be shipped counter to counter to our customer up in Seattle.
Well, as it worked out, Bill and a group of other people took these housings to the airport. But
there had been a shift change, and the United person whom Bill had spoken to no longer was
there. The new person didn't have any idea what was going on. He and Bill had a big argument.
Meanwhile the guy looked over his shoulder and said, ‘Well, it doesn't matter anyhow because it's
too late. There goes the plane right now, backing away from the gate.'</p>
<p>“Having come as far as he had with this, Bill was not going to be denied. He ran through the
United Airlines freight depot onto the ramp. By this time the plane was moving under its own
power, taxiing toward the runway. Bill caught up with the airplane. Got in front of it. Got the pilot's
attention. This was a 737 jet. Got the plane to stop. The pilot almost—well, you know what he
almost did. They took the plane back to the gate. And after all that effort, Bill actually managed to
get the product on the plane. Our customer got his product later that evening in Seattle and
completed his installation the next day.”</p>
<p>What makes this incident even more impressive, McDonald recalls, was that “during this whole
time, none of it was under management's direction. Management was not even aware that any of
this had happened until it was all over. You can't make people do that. You have to make them
want to do that.”</p>
<p>And people will only want to perform like that if they feel like an important part of the
organization. That's why employees need to be respected and included in a corporate vision they
can embrace. That's why people need a stake in their work lives. That's why their successes need to
be rewarded, praised, and celebrated. That's why their failures need to be handled gingerly. Do
those things. Then stand back and watch the results roll in.</p>
<p>There's nothing new about this concept. Dwight Eisenhower was asked once about his secret for
taming the fractious Congress. Did the former general mention military discipline or the mightmakes-
right power of thepresidency? Not even close. He talked about persuasion. “You do not lead
by hitting people over the head,” he said. “That's assault, not leadership.”</p>
<p>Eisenhower added, “I would rather persuade a man to go along because once he has been
persuaded, he will stick. If I scare him, he will stay just as long as he is scared, and then he is gone.”
This power of persuasion was never more important than it is today. Apple Computer
understood that. So did Corning. So do most of the other well-led companies out there. Get people
interested in what they're doing. Truly make it theirs. They'll work and work, and then they'll work
some more.</p>
<p>Once this basic principle is recognized and understood, it's really quite easy to dream up all kinds
of specific motivation techniques. But three important concepts of
human behavior underlie them all.</p>
<p>1. Employees must be included in all parts of the process, every step of the way. Teamwork is the
key here, not hierarchy. <br>2. People must be treated as individuals. Always acknowledge their importance and show them
respect. They're people first, employees second. <br>3. Superior work must be encouraged, recognized, and rewarded. Everyone responds to
expectations. If you treat people as if they are capable and smart—and get out of the way—that's
exactly how they'll perform.</p>
<p>Include people. At the traditional kind of big corporation, people often felt a little disconnected.
Each was just a number, one of thousands, a human cog in a giant industrial wheel. There are
literally hundreds of stories out there, told so often they've become legend, about disgruntled
employees calling in sick or spending more time on break than at their desks. If a company's
employees feel that way, that company is poorly led. Its goals have not become their goals. No
company can succeed in a situation like that.</p>
<p>Successful leaders today involve employees in all aspects of the work process: design,
manufacture, inventory, marketing. Leaders create teams. They don't issue orders from above.
Leaders realize that the employees who actually do the work can actually make decisions. Certainly,
employees who are engaged in real decision making respond better than those who are not.</p>
<p>American Airlines, widely regarded as the best-run company in that tumultuous industry, has
institutionalized a kind of consensus management. Chairman Robert Crandall explains: “This whole
notion of companies this size being run entirely at the will of a single entity is nonsensical. Maybe
there are compares that are run that way, but I don't think so. For the most part, companies like
this one are run on the basis of a consensus judgment. In the end, the chief executive always has to
make the decision and bear the responsibility for it. But my job is much more a matter of exploring
options and bringing a group together and seeking consensus among the members of that group
than it is dictating solutions.”</p>
<p>Martin Edelston, president of Boardroom Reports, runs his business newsletter publishing
company in the same consensus way—by constantly seeking suggestions from his sixty-five
employees.</p>
<p>“You notice when you walk around,” Edelston says, “none of us here is a rocket scientist. These
are all very ordinary people.” So how did these “ordinary people” produce such extraordinary
results? “1 asked everybody for two ideas to make our meetings more interesting,” Edelston
explains. “Now, we've had thousands of ideas from these people on every subject imaginable.”</p>
<p>The whole work force is driven by suggestions, a modification of the Japanese kaizen system for
continuous improvement. “If I asked you for two ways in which I can be better, you'd be
complimented,” Edelston said. “You would tell me how I could make this better. You'd feel really
good if I implemented it. I go back next week, ask for two more, and then two more, so that
something is happening. I've taken sixty-five people and made giants out of them. So we have a
company now that's doing over a million dollars’ worth of business per person.”</p>
<p>Steven Jobs and Steven Wozniak followed a similarly nonhierarchical approach when they began
putting together Apple Computer's executive team. They weren't so concerned about who was the
boss. Peter O. Crisp, managing partner of Venrock Associates, a venture capital firm that got behind
Apple in the early days, still smiles at the founders’ unorthodox style: “They would say to
themselves, ‘We have this device, which has some electronic parts that hopefully we're going to
make many copies of. We need to manufacture them at low cost, and they need to be very reliable.
What company in the country is the best manufacturer of technical products that have those
characteristics?’”</p>
<p>Hewlett-Packard, they concluded. “Jobs and Wozniak would say, ‘Well, let's go find the vice
president of manufacturing for Hewlett-Packard, and let's hire him.' </p>
<p>
“They would try to find the vice president of Hewlett-Packard,” Crisp said. “If they couldn't get
him, they'd try to find out who his assistant was, or they would find out which of Hewlett-Packard's
plants was the best run. They would go and find out who the manufacturing person was there.
They'd go and try to hire him. They gave these people generous options awards. So they would
attract an experienced person, and then they'd say, ‘Okay, now tell us what to do.’ Then the Apple
people would assist the newcomer in implementing his plans.”</p>
<p>Crisp recalls, “They hired a marketing person that way and a manufacturing person, a humanresources
person. They were off to the races. You know, on occasion in a startup, the founder is the
chief scientist. He may be reluctant to hire a chief operating officer because he may not want to
give away too much stock or too much of his authority and have anybody there who can really
challenge him. Entrepreneurs can be very possessive of what they have. In this case it was exactly
the opposite. It was, ‘Let's go.’” And go they did, by engaging their people in the company.</p>
<p>To achieve Apple like results, you've got to follow rule number two. Become interested in your
employees and let them know that you are. Treat people like people. That's the second basic
concept of motivation.</p>
<p>“Be nice to your people and treat them with respect,” says Pelco's David McDonald. “Invest
liberally in your people, and don't expect this automatically to produce new profits. Rather take full
advantage of your newly enhanced human resources by establishing new extreme-type
expectations for your people that translate into exceptional performance for customers and
therefore generate more profits.”</p>
<p>Say hello. Smile. Get to know your employees. “Employees should be handled like family,” says
Joyce Harvey, president of Harmon Associates Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Fort
Howard Corporation. “You can't expect people to do things that you wouldn't do yourself. You've
got to care about them sincerely. Then you can get the same level of respect back.”</p>
<p>Harvey goes on, “My former boss used to have a chart in his office. He'd flip it, and it had every
employee who worked here. He knew them by name, and he knew their families; he knew what was
happening. He'd walk through the mill and say, ‘Hi, Joe,’ ‘Hi, Sam,’ ‘Hi, Mary.’ He let them know that
he cared.” That may sound old-fashioned, but it's even more important today.</p>
<p>The third basic concept of motivation is just as important as the other two: Acknowledge a job
well done. Don't be the tight-lipped, disapproving parent many of us grew up with. Those were the
parents who didn't congratulate their kids for getting that A on the report card. They just expected
it. Remember how disappointing that was? Well, it's still disappointing. There's still a little child in
every one of us, waiting to be praised. So don't forget: People want to betold when they've done a
good job. Use praise liberally and often.</p>
<p>There are literally dozens of simple techniques for celebrating successes. At Cox Cable, Bill
Geppert seems to use just about every last one. “We have rallies,” Geppert says. “We have
meetings. We do skits during our monthly meeting to reinforce that message and keep those visible
targets and goals in front of our folks. We have celebrations. We load people up in army trucks and
drive them across town and talk about how we're going to be competitive with the tougher
competitors. We've had fireworks in our celebrations, performers brought in to exemplify the
excellence we strive for. We have speakers, awards. We give away money at employee meetings.
Any way to get people involved and excited.”</p>
<p>John P. Imlay, Jr., chairman of Dun & Bradstreet Software Services, Inc., has his own method for
rewarding employees. “I had a theme all through my career,” he recalls. “It was very simple: People
are the key. I had Tiffany & Co. create a little key which we all wore in our lapels. Sounds a little
corny. But at the time, we'd come through bankruptcy, and I wanted to reward those people. The
people took it with great emotion. A silver key, if you were with us less than five years. You got a
gold when you hit five years. The women got a diamond for ten years.”</p>
<p>However you do it, do it. Let the people in your life know that you respect them, that you
appreciate their work, that they are important to you and that you want them to learn, grow, and
reach their potential.</p>
<p>Motivation, that's called.</p>

<h2 align="center">MOTIVATION CAN NEVER BE FORCED. PEOPLE HAVE TO WANT TO DO A
GOOD JOB.</h2><br>
