<h2 align="center">SETTING GOALS</h2><br>


<p><i>At age twenty-three I was one of the unhappiest young men in New York. I was selling motor trucks
for a living. I didn't know what made a motor truck run. That wasn't all: I didn't want to know. I
despised my job. I despised living in a cheap furnished room on West Fifty-sixth Street—a room
infested with cockroaches. I still remember that I had a bunch of neckties hanging on the walls, and
when I reached out every morning to get a fresh necktie, the cockroaches scattered in all directions. I
despised having to eat in cheap, dirty restaurants that were also probably infested with cockroaches.
I came home to my lonely room each night with a sick headache—a headache bred and fed by
disappointment, worry, bitterness, and rebellion. I was rebelling because the dreams I had nourished
back in my college days had turned into nightmares. Was this life? Was this the vital adventure to
which I had looked forward so eagerly? Was this all life would ever mean to me—working at a job I
despised and with no hope for the future? I longed for leisure to read. I longed to write the books I
had dreamed of writing back in my college days.</i></p>
<p><i>I knew I had everything to gain and nothing to lose by giving up the job I despised. I wasn't interested
in making a lot of money, but I was interested in making a lot of living. In short, I had come to the
Rubicon - to that moment of decision which faces most young people when they set out in life. So I
made my decision, and that decision completely altered my future. It has made the rest of my life
happy and rewarding beyond my most My decision was this: 1 would give up the work I loathed, and
since I had spent four years studying in the State Teachers College at Warrensburg, Missouri,
preparing to teach, I would make my living teaching adult classes in night schools. Then I would have
my days free to read books, prepare lectures, write novels and short stories. I wanted “to live to write
and write to live.”</i><b>—DALE CARNEGIE</b></p>
<p>Dale Carnegie never wrote the great American novel, but his remarkable success as a teacher, a
businessman, and a writer of human-relations books has made him an inspiration to people
around the world. He achieved all that by setting goals for himself, adjusting those goals as
circumstances required, and trying never to lose sight of where he was headed next.</p>
<p>Mary Lou Retton was just a high-school sophomore from West Virginia, a state that had never
once produced a world-class gymnast.</p>
<p>“I was a nobody,” she says, “and I was number one in the state.” She was a tiny fourteen-yearold,
performing at a competition in Reno, Nevada. That's the day the great BelaKarolyi, the
Romanian gymnastics coach who had guided Nadia Comaneci to Olympic gold, walked up behind
Mary Lou.</p>
<p>“He was the king of gymnastics,” Retton recalls. “He came up to me. He tapped me on the
shoulder. He's a big man—six-three or six-four. He came up to me and said, ‘Mary Lou/ in that deep
Romanian accent. ‘You come to me, and I will make you Olympic champion.'”</p>
<p>The first thought that went racing through Retton's mind was, “Yeah, right. No way.”</p>
<p>The first thought that went racing through Retton's mind was, “Yeah, right. No way.”</p>
<p>What a goal that was! Since early childhood she had harbored dreams about one day performing
in the Olympics. But hearing the words come out of the great man's mouth —as far as Retton was
concerned, that set the goal in stone.</p>
<p>“It was a very big risk for me,” she says. “I was going to be moving away from my family and my
friends, living with a family I had never met before, training with girls I didn't know. It pumped me
up so much. I was scared. I didn't know what to expect. But I was excited too. This man wanted to
train me. Little me, from Fairmont, West Virginia. I had been picked out.”</p>
<p>And she wasn't about to let Karolyi down. It was two and a half years later that Mary Lou Retton,
after a pair of perfect tens, won the Olympic gold medal in gymnastics for America —and with it a
place in the hearts of people everywhere.</p>
<p>Goals give us something to shoot for. They keep our efforts focused. They allow us to measure
our success.</p>
<p>So set goals—goals that are challenging but also realistic, goals that are clear and measurable,
goals for the short term and goals for the long term.</p>
<p>When you reach one goal, take a second to pat yourself on the back. Then move on to the next
goal, emboldened, strengthened, energized by what you've already achieved.</p>
<p>Eugene Lang, a New York City philanthropist, was making a graduation speech to a sixth-grade
class at PS 121. This class had a group of children with absolutely no hope of ever going to college.
In fact, there was very little hope that most of these children would even graduate from high
school. But at the end of the graduation speech, Lang made a stunning offer. “For any of you who
graduate from high school, I will ensure that funds are available for you to go to college,” he said.
Of the forty-eight students in that sixth-grade class that day, forty-four graduated from high school
and forty-two went to college. To put that into perspective, remember that forty percent of innercity
students never graduate from high school, let alone go to college.</p>
<p>That monetary offer alone wasn't enough to ensure such great success. Lang also made sure that
the students got the support they needed along the way. They were monitored and counseled
through their last six years of school. But that one challenging goal, clearly articulated and within
the students’ reach, gave them an opportunity to visualize a future they never thought was
possible. And by visualizing it for themselves, they were able to make their dreams reality.</p>
<p>In the words of Harvey Mackay, the best-selling business author, “A goal is a dream with a
deadline.”</p>
<p>Howard Marguleas is the chairman of a produce company called Sun World, and he's one of
California's new breed of growers. He got to be that way by setting and meeting goal after goal. For
years Marguleas had watched as the agriculture business went up and down—fat times, lean times,
as impossible to predict as they were to control. At least that's how everyone said the fruit-andvegetable
business worked.</p>
<p>But Marguleas had a goal: to develop new and unique kinds of produce that could withstand the
shifts in the tides of consumer buying. “This business is really no different from real estate,”
Marguleas reasoned. “When the market's down, unless you have something very highly, uniquely
different, you're in serious trouble. Same thing in agriculture. If you're just another producer of
lettuce, carrots, or oranges, and you have nothing different from anyone else, you do well only if
there's a short supply. If there's a large supply, you won't do well. And that's what we've tried to
adjust to, to find the windows of opportunity that come with being different, a niche in the
marketplace.”</p>
<p>That's where the idea of a better pepper came from. Yes, a better pepper. If he could develop a
pepper that wastastier than the peppers that other people grew, Marguleas assured himself,
wouldn't the grocers of America want to stock it in good times and in bad?</p>
<p>So he did it, giving birth to the Le Rouge Royal pepper. “It's an elongated, three-lobe pepper,”
Marguleas says. “We were told, you know, ‘You have to have a bell pepper, a square-shaped
pepper, to sell.’ But once we tasted this pepper —the color, the flavor, everything about it—we
knew we had something. We knew that if we promoted it properly and advertised and
merchandised it and put a name on it, we could get people to eat it. And once they ate it, they
were going to continue to buy it.”</p>
<p>What all this taught Marguleas is, “Never cease to pursue the opportunity to seek something
different. Don't be satisfied with what you're doing. Always try to seek a way and a method to
improve upon what you're doing, even if it's considered contrary to the traditions of an industry.”
Those who fail to establish independent goals for themselves become, in Marguleas's word, the
“me-toos” of the world. The me-toos, the people who follow but don't lead, do fine when times are
good. But when times get tough, they inevitably get left behind.Marguleas had his finger on something there. People who set goals—challenging goals, but goals
that are also achievable—are the ones with solid grips on their futures, the ones who end up
accomplishing extraordinary things. Reebok International, Ltd., the athletic-shoe company, set a
major corporate goal for itself: get Shaquille O'Neal. The Orlando Magic star wasn't going to come
easy. Lots of major companies were eager to hire him as their spokesman. “It was a question of
convincing him that we had the best commitment to him, that we were willing to do something to
create for him a program that the next guy couldn't do,” says Paul Fireman, Reebok's chairman.</p>

<p>The whole company geared up. “We created an ad campaign before he was here. We created it
for himexclusively. We spent money to create it, and we really put our effort in. We were just
absolutely committed to getting him. We took a gamble. We took a risk. We spent the money, the
time, and the commitment.” Sometimes that's what setting goals is all about.</p>
<p>“It would have been a major confrontation emotionally if we had lost,” Fireman said. “If we
didn't go so far to get him here, we wouldn't have had the loss emotionally. But we wouldn't have
had the player, either.”</p>
<p>Goals aren't important only for companies. They're the building blocks that successful careers are
made of.</p>
<p>Jack Gallagher worked in the family tire business, where he had held just about every job—
accounting, bookkeeping, manufacturing, and sales. All that experience in the tire business taught
him one thing for sure: he didn't want to work in the tire business.</p>
<p>One day Gallagher ran into a high-school friend who was working as an assistant administrator
at a local hospital. “That's what I'd like to do,” Gallagher told himself. “I'd love to help people. I'd
love to have a big business, and I'd love to lead a group for the right things.” There were several
giant hurdles between Jack Gallagher and a hospital administrator's job —a graduate degree in
hospital administration, for one thing, and a job at a hospital, for another. But Gallagher had his
goal, and he got started jumping the hurdles right away.</p>
<p>He talked his way into Yale. He won a stipend from the Kellogg Foundation. He got a loan from a
local bank. He worked nights in the business office of North Shore University Hospital. And after he
got the graduate degree, he applied for an administrative residency at North Shore.</p>
<p>“I interviewed with Jack Hausman, the chairman of the hospital's board,” Gallagher recalls. “I
must have spent three minutes with him, and I sold him in three minutes. He asked me a funny
question. He knew I was married and had three kids. He said, ‘How are you going to afford it?’ They
paid thirty-nine hundred for a resident then.” Gallagher recalls how he responded: “Look, Mr.
Hausman, I thought it out a long time before I came to see you here. I had to have everything set so
I could live during this residency and move into an administrative role after that.”</p>
<p>He had a goal. He planned every detail. He worked tirelessly toward them. He's North Shore's
CEO today.</p>
<p>Singer-songwriter Nail Sedaka, whose pop-music career has spanned more than three decades,
learned to set goals when he was just a kid. Sedaka grew up in a rough part of Brooklyn, and he
was never one of the tough guys. His earliest goal was a perfectly understandable one: to be liked
and thereby stay alive through high school.</p>
<p>“I wasn't a fighter,” Sedaka explained recently. “So I had to be liked. I always wanted to be liked.
You know how it is. You're always afraid of getting into a fight.” Anyway, young Neil came up with
what turned out to be an ingenious method of achieving his personal goal—music.</p>
<p>“There was a sweetshop near Lincoln High School, and there was a jukebox in the back,” he
recalled. “All the tough kids, the leather-set kids, would hang out there, and they would listen to
Elvis and Fats Domino. This was the beginning of rock and roll. So I wrote a rock-and-roll song, and I
sang it, and then I was like a hero with those leather-set kids. They even let me into their part of
the sweetshop.”</p>
<p>The point here isn't whether Sedaka should have cared about acceptance from the tough kids.
These things can seem awfully important in the high-school years. But he knew instinctively how to
reach these other people —and how to achieve what was important to him at the time. For Sedaka,
that high-school goal turned into a lifelong career, and this early success gave him the confidence
to shoot for the stars in the future.</p>
<p>Much the same process unfolded in the early life of Arthur Ashe, the late tennis champion.
Almost single-handedly, Ashe broke down the color barrier in professional tennis, a game that until
he came along had been almost exclusively white. In his later years, Ashe fought a valiant battle
against the AIDS virus, raising consciousness about the disease on ghetto street corners and in
townhouse drawing rooms.</p>
<p>His was a life of setting and reaching goals. For Ashe it started when he was a youngster on a
tennis court. That's where he learned about achievement, one goal at a time.</p>
<p>“Breaking through that barrier, where you have set a goal and you achieve that goal, it sort of
codifies whatever budding self-confidence you might have had,” Ashe said in an interview for this
book just before his death.</p>
<p>That's how Ashe operated until the day he died. He'd set a goal and when he'd met that goal,
he'd set another one. Why? “The self-confidence itself, I think, transforms the individual,” he
explained. “It also spills over into other areas of life. Not only do you feel confident in whatever
you are expert at, but you probably feel generally self-confident that you can do some other things
as well, applying the same principles maybe to another task or to another set of goals.”</p>

<p>The goals must be realistic, and they must be attainable. Don't make the mistake of thinking you
should, or can, accomplish everything today. Maybe you can't reach the moon this year, so plan a
shorter trip. Set an interim goal.</p>
<p>Following that incremental approach, Ashe put himself on the big-time tennis map. “My early
coaches,” explained Ashe, “set out definite goals which I bought into. The goals were not
necessarily winning tennis tournaments. The goals were just things that we saw as difficult, that
would require some hard work and some planning. And there was sort of an implied reward out
there if I achieved those goals. Again, the goal wasn't necessarily winning this tournament or that
tournament. And so incrementally, before I knew it, after I attained these mini goals along the way,
all of a sudden, ‘Hey, I'm close to the big prize here.'”</p>
<p>That's how Ashe always approached tough tennis matches. “In a tournament, you'd want to get
to the quarterfinals. Or in a match, you would want to not miss a certain number of backhand
passing shots. Or maybe you'd want to improve your stamina to a point where you're not going to
get tired when the weather is too hot. Those are the sorts of goals that help take your general
focus off that long-range, elusive goal— the goal of being number one or winning the whole
tournament.”</p>
<p>Most big challenges are best faced with a series of interim goals. That's a far more encouraging
process —far more motivating too.</p>
<p>Dr. James D. Watson, the director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, has been locked in a
lifelong struggle to find the cure for cancer. Is that his only goal? Of course not. That would be too
discouraging for anyone to bear. Watson has laid out a series of incremental goals for himself and
his laboratory colleagues, goals they are meeting every year on the road to the ultimate cure.</p>
<p>“There are so many different cancers,” explains Watson, who won a Nobel prize for discovering
the structure of DNA. “We're going to cure some of them. Hopefully, we'll cure more of them.</p>
<p>“But you've got to pick interim goals,” he says. “The goal is not to kill colon cancer tomorrow. It's
to understand the disease. And there are many different steps. No one wants to be led into defeat.
You get your happiness one small goal at a time.”</p>
<p>That's the way it works. Set little goals. Meet them. Set new, slightly larger goals. Meet them.
Succeed.</p>
<p>Long before Lou Holtz became Notre Dame's head football coach, he wanted nothing more than
to play the game himself. But when he went out for his high-school team, he weighed just 115
pounds.</p>
<p>Holtz knew this was far too small. Still, he desperately wanted to play, so he came up with a
plan. He memorized all eleven positions on the team. That way, if any player got hurt, he was
immediately prepared to rush onto the field. It gave him eleven chances instead of one. “It's the
same way in business today,” says writer Harvey Mackay. “If you're working out here in the office,
volunteer to learn the phone system. Volunteer to know what's going on in computers. If you're in
sales, you want to know about computers.” That way, when opportunities appear, you'll have a
much greater chance of seizing them. Set goals that make you more valuable to your team—as Lou
Holtz did—or to your company.</p>
<p>The idea is to set goals and then strive to meet them. Sometimes you'll succeed on schedule,
sometimes things will take longer to achieve than you thought, and sometimes you won't attain
what you thought you would. Some things just aren't meant to be. The point is to keep planning
and plugging away. You'll get there, just watch.</p>
<p>As Scalamandre Silks’ Adriana Bitter says: “Maybe we set our goals too high sometimes and we
don't always reach the top end, but we certainly can start climbing that ladder.”</p>
<p>Without specific goals it's far too easy just to drift, never really taking charge of your life. Time
gets wasted because nothing has a sense of urgency. There's no deadline. Nothing has to be done
today. It's possible to put off anything indefinitely. Goals are what can give us direction and keep
us focused.</p>
<p>David Luther of Corning is acutely aware of this modern propensity toward aimlessness. He
worries about how it might affect his own children at home. So he's constantly talking to them
about goals.</p>
<p>“Sometimes,” he reminds them, “we get caught up in things.” Easy to say, of course, but how to
avoid this pitfall? “The point,” according to Luther, “is to know yourself. Think what it is that you
know and want to do. Forget the money, for a moment anyway. When you get to be the age of
your parents, what is it you want to be able to point to that met your expectation, that made a
difference?”</p>
<p>How are intelligent goals created? Mostly they just take a little thought, but there are some
useful techniques for getting the mind focused on the task. You might try asking yourself the same
questions Luther urges his children toask. “Stand back and say, ‘What is it I really want to be? What
kind of life do I really want to lead? Am I heading in the right direction now?’” That advice makes
sense no matter how far along you are in your career.</p>
<p>Once you establish what your goals are, prioritize them. Not everything can be done at once, so
you've got to ask yourself, Which comes first? What goal is most important to me now? Then try
organizing your time and energy to reflect those priorities. This, often, is the most challenging part.
To prioritize his goals, Ted Owen, publisher of the San Diego Business Journal, follows the advice
he got from a psychologist friend. “He told me to take a piece of paper and draw a line down the
center. On the left, put any number you want. I put ten. Put the top ten things that you want to
accomplish in your life before you retire at whatever age that is, one hundred or sixty or fifty.</p>
<p>“Put down those ten things. So you want to have a good retirement program. You want to have a
nice home. You want to have a happy marriage. You want to have good health. Whatever those ten
are. Then over here on the other side, you take those ten and prioritize them. One of those ten
becomes number one, and so on.”</p>
<p>Simplistic? Maybe. But helpful too. Through this process, Owen discovered some things about
himself he never knew. “I found out that a job, a well-paying, steady job, a job that makes me feel
good, was about number seven.” Once you identify your own number one, two, three, and seven,
creating well-crafted goals becomes a whole lot easier.</p>
<p>It's fine if, over the years, those goals develop and change. “Before I was married, I would come
in on the weekends just to read the newspaper here,” says Dr. Ronald Evans, a research professor
at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. “I had nothing else to do. I loved being in labs. It was sort
of a home away from home. Research is addicting,” he observes. “It's incredibly challenging and
pushes your intellectual limits. You make discoveries, and there's nothing like it.” But life changes,
pressures change, and goals should be evaluated too. “With a family now,” Evans goes on, “it's
been very difficult to change my habits, but I have. You just have to say you can't do everything.”</p>
<p>Corporations need goals as much as individuals do, and the same basic rules apply when
companies begin defining theirs: make them clear, keep them basic, and don't set too many at
once.</p>
<p>The huge Motorola corporation was run in one recent year with just three specific goals,
expressed in precise, mathematical terms: to “continue 10-X improvement” every two years, to “get
the voice of” the customer, to “cut business-process cycle time by factor 10” in five years.</p>
<p>Don't worry about what this language means. It may or may not apply at your company. What's
important here is that the company has its goals. These goals are clearly understood within the
company. The goals are challenging but attainable. Progress is easily measurable. And if these goals
are achieved, the company will have done extraordinarily well.</p>
<p>Those three specific goals provide enough vision to run an entire company. Imagine what three
equally clear, equally realistic goals can do for one person's life.</p>
