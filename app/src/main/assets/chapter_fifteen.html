<h2 align="center">LEARNING NOT TO WORRY</h2><br>


<p><i>Many years ago, a neighbor rang my doorbell one evening and urged me and my family to be
vaccinated against smallpox. He was only one of thousands of volunteers who were ringing doorbells
all over New York City. Frightened people stood in lines for hours at a time to be vaccinated.
Vaccination stations were opened not only in all hospitals, but also in firehouses, police precincts, and
in large industrial plants. More than two thousand doctors and nurses worked feverishly day and
night, vaccinating crowds. Eight people in New York City had smallpox—and two had died. Two deaths
out of a population of almost eight million.</i></p>
<p><i>Now, I had lived in New York for many, many years, and no one had ever yet rung my doorbell to warn
me against the emotional sickness of worry—an illness that, during the same time period, had caused
ten thousand times more damage than smallpox.</i></p>
<p><i>No doorbell ringer had ever warned me that one person out of ten now living in these United States
will have a nervous breakdown—induced in the vast majority of cases by worry and emotional
conflicts. So I am writing this chapter to ring your doorbell and warn you.</i></p>
<p><i>Please take to heart the words of Dr. Alexis Carrel: “Those who do not know how to fight worry die
young.”</i><b>—DALE CARNEGIE</b></p>
<p>In the years since Dale Carnegie wrote that, we have learned to treat—even to prevent—many of
the diseases that worried people most. No doubt in the years to come we will cure many of the
diseases that worry us today. But as for the crippling disease of worry, we seem to have made
almost no progress at all. It ravages have only grown worse.</p>
<p>Nowhere is this more true than in today's volatile business world. Layoffs, buyouts, and
corporate restructurings. Downsizings, cutbacks, and sudden invitations to clean out your desk.
Retrenchments. Outplacements. Pare backs. Some days you need a whole new dictionary just to
keep the euphemisms straight. And if that's not enough to cause an ulcer or two, how does “cost
containment” sound? Or “hostile takeover?”</p>
<p>Companies that were once considered solid as redwoods are being shaken to their very roots.
Countless others—big names from the annals of business history —have been chopped up and
carried away. Whole layers of middle management vaporized: what middle manager wouldn't
worry about that? Companies shedding divisions the way snakes shed their scales: what division
chief wouldn't be concerned? A brand-new breed of corporate raider, looking lustfully for
companies with extra fat: what well-ensconced executive wouldn't feel a nervous twinge?</p>
<p>Yes, changes were necessary. Some of them were long overdue. The clear-eyed truth is this:
companies that don't stay lean and competitive, that aren't creative and flexible, that don't move
quicker than the competition—those are the dinosaurs of today. And their futures are just about
as bright.</p>
<p>But change causes anxiety. Change causes stress. It makes people nervous. It makes them
concerned. Of course it does. Many of the assumptions that were once considered unshakable —
assumptions that people built their professional lives around—turn out not to be so unshakable
anymore. It's only natural to feel a little insecure. It used to be that most of the patients who
walked into Dr. Marvin Frogel's psychiatric office wanted to talk about problems they were having
at home— anger with the spouse, frustration with the children, resentment over how they were
raised. Obviously, people are still concerned about those issues. But far more of Frogel's patients
today are racked with worry over what is happening at work.</p>
<p>“People are terrified they're going to lose their jobs,” says Dr. Frogel, who practices in Great
Neck, New York. “That's something I never saw before. People are walking in the door literally
quaking about what will happen at work.</p>
<p>“You get one shakeout, and then everyone is waiting for the other shoe to drop. And it's not just
two shoes, it's twenty shoes. People get fired. Then come the early-retirement programs. Then the
layoffs. People don't know if they're going to have a job the next day.”</p>
<p>“Look at IBM,” says Earl Graves, editor of Black Enterprise magazine. In recent years the onceinvincible
computer giant has experienced major cutbacks, as its dominance was challenged by
smaller companies in America and abroad.</p>
<p>“It doesn't mean they will never come back. But when they're laying off people in Poughkeepsie,
IBM will never be the same company again. That's turmoil, and that's when you've got to say,
‘Where's your happiness going to be?’ People who are leaving IBM are finding out that life is not
over. When you think your wings have been clipped, you'll find out you can still fly. You think,
leaving IBM, you can't fly out of the nest, but you can.”</p>
<p>When Dale Carnegie first turned his attention to the subject of worry, the world was still gripped
by the Great Depression. He could see the jagged lines of worry on the faces of his students and
friends.</p>
<p>“As the years went by,” Carnegie wrote, “I realized that worry was one of the biggest problems
that adults had to face. A large majority of my students were businessmen—executives, salesmen,
engineers, accountants, a cross section of all the trades and professions—and most of them had
problems. There were women in the classes—businesswomen and housewives. They had problems
too. Clearly, what I needed was a textbook on how to conquer worry. So I tried to find one.</p>
<p>“I went to New York's great public library at Fifth Avenue and Forty-second Street and discovered
to my great astonishment that this library had only twenty-two books listed under the title Worry. I
also noticed, to my amusement, that it had one hundred eighty-nine books listed under Worms.
Almost nine times as many books about worms as about worry ! Astounding, isn't it?</p>
<p>“Since worry is one of the biggest problems facing humanity, you would think, wouldn't you, that
every high school and college in the land would give a course on how to stop worrying? Yet if there
is even one course on that subject in any college in the land, I have never heard of it.”</p>
<p>Carnegie spent seven years reading and studying about worry. He interviewed all the leading
experts of the day. He read every worry book he could get his hands on, most of which turned out
to be dense, psychiatric treatises or for some other reason inadequate as practical guides. Carnegie
did more than read and study, though. He relied on what he called his “laboratory for conquering
worry"—the adult-education classes he was teaching most nights.</p>
<p>Out of all that research came a book about worry and stress: How to Stop Worrying and Start
Living, published in 1944. For the first time ever, the basic techniques for overcoming worry were
laid out in a simple, straightforward way. These techniques have been updated and revised many
times over the years, as new causes for worry have presented themselves.</p>
<p>Learn these techniques. Apply them every day. Almost certainly, you will gain greater control
over your life. You will experience less stress and worry. You will end up mentally and physically
healthier too.</p>
<h3>LIVE IN DAY-TIGHT COMPARTMENTS.</h3>
<p>Business was slow at Chase Manhattan Financial Services in San Diego, California. The loan
department was already $9 million behind on the year. The people who worked in the department
were growing increasingly tense with each other. And Becky Connolly, the loan-office manager, was
so worried she could barely sleep at night.</p>

<h3>LIVE IN DAY-TIGHT COMPARTMENTS.</h3>
<p>Business was slow at Chase Manhattan Financial Services in San Diego, California. The loan
department was already $9 million behind on the year. The people who worked in the department
were growing increasingly tense with each other. And Becky Connolly, the loan-office manager, was
so worried she could barely sleep at night.</p>
<p>Then she decided to try living in day-tight compartments. “Listen,” she told the staff. “This has
always been a cyclical business. Loans have always come in waves. Just focus on your daily
activities, your customer calls, servicing and following up on the advertising. We'll all get through
this slump.” The results? A happier, more productive work force, and soon enough loan activity
picked up.</p>
<p>It's mind-boggling to think about how much energy gets wasted on the future and on the past.
The past is over, and the future hasn't yet arrived. Try as we might, we are utterly unable to affect
either one. There's only one time we can possible live in. That time is the present. That time is
today.</p>
<p>“You and I,” Dale Carnegie wrote, “are standing this very second at the meeting place of two
eternities: the vast past that has endured forever, and the future that is plunging on to the last
syllable of recorded time. We can't possibly live in either of those eternities—no, not even for one
split second. But by trying to do so, we can wreck both our bodies and our minds. So let's be
content to live the only time we can possibly live: from now until bedtime.”</p>
<p>Remember this, and don't go crazy worrying about what might have been. Don't get all tied up in
anxiety about things that may or may not happen at some future time. Focus your attention
instead on the one place where you can do any good—the reality of life today.</p>
<p>So give up the wallowing, and give up the butterflies. Sure, think about tomorrow and learn from
yesterday. Plan ahead and try to improve upon the experiences of the past. But while you're doing
all that, remember that the future and the past are the two things nobody can possibly change.
Singer-songwriter Neil Sedaka learned this truism from his mother. “She always said, ‘Take each
day as a gift. Try to live with the good and the bad, looking more at the good.'”</p>
<p>Is that easy? “It's a constant struggle,” Sedaka agrees, “but I think it can be done. We all have our
problems, and going through the day it hits us. Try to push it away. You've got to.” Work in the
realm of the present. Put your energy, put your attention, put your drive where it will count: today.
And then get to work. You just may be surprised by how much can be accomplished in one daytight
compartmentAs the Scottish poet Robert Louis Stevenson said, “Anyone can carry his burden, however hard,
until nightfall. Anyone can do his work, however hard, for one day. Anyone can live sweetly,
patiently, lovingly, purely, till the sun goes down. And this is all that life really means.”</p>
<p>As the Scottish poet Robert Louis Stevenson said, “Anyone can carry his burden, however hard,
until nightfall. Anyone can do his work, however hard, for one day. Anyone can live sweetly,
patiently, lovingly, purely, till the sun goes down. And this is all that life really means.”</p>
<h3>TAKE COMFORT FROM THE LAW OF AVERAGES.</h3>
<p>Theo Bergauer could see immediately that something was wrong. Bergauer is the general
manager of Karl Bergauer GmbH & Co. KG, the largest construction company in Northern Bavaria.
His secretary of many years looked like she was about to cry.</p>
<p>“What's the matter with you?” Bergauer asked the woman.</p>
<p>She told him that her son had just joined the German army. “The part of the army he joined,
they're the first people to go to a foreign country to help out.” Problems were just then brewing in
Yugoslavia, and she was worried sick that her boy was about to be sent off to his death.</p>
<p>Bergauer didn't quite know what to say, but he thought about odds for a minute. “What are the
odds that his part of the German forces will be called to go to Yugoslavia?”</p>
<p>About one in a hundred, they decided.</p>
<p>So the two of them made an agreement. Bergauer explains, “If this one percent came into reality,
then she would worry a little. But until then there was no reason to worry at all.”</p>
<p>By asking yourself just one question—and paying attention to what the answer is—you chase a
good chunk of worry from your life. The question is this: “How likely is this thing to happen,
anyway?”</p>
<p></p>

<p>Most people spend far too much time worrying about things that never occur. In fact, most of
the things that most people worry about don't happen. That's worth remembering. “My life,” wrote
the French philosopher Montaigne, “has been full of terrible misfortunes, most of which never
happened.”</p>
<p>One useful trick is to try placing mathematical odds on the things that you worry most about.
That's what business writer Harvey Mackay has done for most of his life. “Once you know the facts
and put a probability on them,” Mackay says, “you can see the situation in its proper perspective.”
The odds that this airplane will crash: maybe one in one hundred thousand. That you will get
fired some time this year: maybe one in five hundred, one in a thousand. The odds are probably
even smaller than that. The odds that you will dump a cup of coffee on your desk: okay, maybe one
in a hundred. But who really cares about that?</p>
<p>“So if somebody's opening up a rival business across the street, okay, sounds terrible,” Mackay
says. “But wait a minute. It's going to take them three years to get the equipment. We've been here
thirty-two years, and we've got all this experience, all this know-how, and all this good will. So how
likely do you think it is that they're really going to hurt us? Go ahead. Put odds on it.” Probably not
as much as you imagined at first.</p>
<p>“You can make these predictions on every single thing,” Mackay points out. “Is so-and-so going
out of business? Is someone else coming out of Chapter 11? What's going to happen here? What
about the mayor? Who's going to get elected? Who's he going to appoint? It's such a great game to
play. You're not betting your money, but it helps you put things into perspective. It keeps you
sharp. It can make you very humble too.</p>
<h3>COOPERATE WITH THE INEVITABLE.</h3>
<p>For six years David Rutt had been a supervisor with Expediters International, a West Coast
import-export firm. Then the job of import manager came open.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately,” Rutt recalls, “I didn't get the promotion.” He could have let this setback turn
into bitterness. He could have lost interest in the position he did have. But he didn't. “I resolved
not to worry about the past and to turn this loss into a gain,” he says. “I resolved to help the new
manager in any way I could during his first few difficult months on the job.”</p>
<p>The payback? “I was recently given the position of assistant import manager,” Rutt says.</p>
<p>Follow Rutt's advice: don't waste time and energy worrying about the things you cannot control.
“There are so many times I have had worries and tension and didn't have solutions for them,”
says Andres Navarro, the Chilean businessman. “What do you do when you're a teenager and you
fall in love with a girl and she doesn't love you? There's no solution for it. You feel sad, and you feel
turned down, but after a while, the question just disappears. You don't find a solution. You just
live with it.”</p>
<p>Every day our lives will be peppered with unpleasant realities of various sorts. Some of them we
will be lucky enough or skillful enough to change. But there will always be problems that are
beyond our reach.</p>
<p>Crime and poverty, the number of hours in a day, the fact that others have a grip on important
parts of our lives—those are just immutable facts. Despite our strongest efforts, despite our most
creative ideas, despite all the assistance we can muster on our behalf—despite all of that, some
things we simple cannot control.</p>
<p>Too bad, isn't it, that we aren't all masters of the universe? And too bad that other people don't
always do exactly what we would like. That's just life, and the sooner we learn to accept it, the
happier and more successful we will be. That's what Mother Goose was driving at:</p>
<p>For every ailment under the sun There is a remedy, or there is none.</p>
<p>If there be one, try to find it If there be none, never mind it. <br>The real trick is telling them apart.</p>
<p>Obviously, circumstances do not make us happy or unhappy. It's how we react to them. But we
really don't have much choice about accepting the inevitable. The alternative is usually a life of
disappointment and bitterness.</p>
<p>It's when we stop fighting the inevitable that we have the time, the energy, and the creativity to
solve the problems that we can. “Be willing to have it so,” said Henry James. “Acceptance of what
has happened is the first step to overcoming the consequences of any misfortune.”</p>
<h3>PUT A STOP-LOSS ORDER ON YOUR WORRIES.</h3>
<p>Like many hospitals, Sharp Cabrillo has been going through some difficult times. Lori England, a
clinical specialist, was right in the middle of a big wave of layoffs, and she was certain she would be
next. The whole situation at work was beginning to make her depressed.</p>
<p>But she made a decision about her life: she wasn't going to devote any more worry to the
uncertainties at the hospital. She would instead start having fun at work-
She started teaching CPR. She put extra enthusiasm into other parts of her job. People started
noticing her efforts especially against the glum background of everyone else.“Who do you think will be laid off in the future?” England asks. “Someone down and worried? Or
a valuable member of the team, throwing enthusiasm into everything she does?”
Try asking yourself the question that Wall Street investors ask themselves whenever the market
falls: How much of a loss am I willing to take on this investment? If the market turns unexpectedly,
how far will I allow this stock to fall? At what point do I just take the beating and walk away?
A stop-loss order, it's called on Wall Street. The message to the trader is, Sell the stock if it falls
below a certain price. I'll eat the loss, but I'm not going to throw away my fortune on a single
mistaken call.</p>

<p>You can follow the same system when it comes to worry. Ask yourself, How much worry is this
one problem worth? Is it worth one sleepless night? Is it worth a week's worth of anxiety? Is it
worth an ulcer to me? Very, very few problems should be. Decide in advance how much worry a
problem is worth.</p>
<p>A job in a poorly run company, an employee who refuses to join team efforts, a supplier who
delivers shoddy service-every one of those is a subject worthy of energy and concern. But how
much? That's what you need to decide. Eventually, a time may come that you will simply have to
say, “Get me a headhunter” or “Put him on probation” or “Hand me the vendor's list.”
No problem is worth all the worry in the world.</p>
<h3>KEEP THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE.</h3>
<p>Some things aren't worth worrying about at all. They're just too tiny. Will my hair get messed up
in the wind? Will my grass be greener than my neighbor's? Did the boss smile at me today? Most of
the time it just doesn't matter. Yet we all know people who have turned their lives inside out over
such trivialities. What a waste!</p>
<p>Some things in life really matter. Some things do not. You can cut your worry in half by learning
to tell them apart. Golfer Chi Chi Rodriguez had this kind of perspective.</p>
<p>At the Northville Senior Classic, about 250 spectators had gathered to watch Rodriguez tee off.
He was always known to put on an enjoyable show.</p>
<p>At the back of the tee box, a boy was sitting in a wheelchair. No one was paying the boy much
attention, least of all the professional golfers who had preceded Rodriguez to the tee. Their minds
were more likely on the tournament's $450,000 purse.</p>
<p>Just before he teed off, Rodriguez noticed the boy, and he walked over to say hello. Rodriguez
took a golf glove from his pocket and placed it over the young boy's hand. This took considerable
care, since the hand was severely malformed. Then Rodriguez autographed the glove and gave the
boy a ball. By then the boy's face was filled with excitement and joy at the recognition he had just
received from this star.</p>
<p>The crowd responded with loud applause at Rodriguez's act of kindness. Upon hearing the
applause Rodriguez looked embarrassed. He held up his hands and gazed at the sky as if to say: “I
don't deserve the applause. The person who is suffering and his family are the true heroes here.”
Although Rodriguez was focused on the golf match, he also recognized what the larger stakes of
life can be. Stepping up to help other people: that's a terrific worry-fighting technique.</p>
<h3>FINALLY, GET BUSY.</h3>
<p>Nothing takes your mind off worry like having it occupied with something else. That's a
technique professional actors need to learn in a hurry. “When you're up for a big film,” says
Annette Bening, who has had major roles in Bugsy, The Grifters, and other films, “the waiting
period can be months. They meet you. Then they go away. They meet other people. Then they
come back. They meet you again. One thing I found useful was to start working on the part. I would
actually go to work.</p>
<p>There was one in particular that was going to take a lot of reading. So I found myself—as a way
of dealing with the anxiety of not knowing what the outcome was going to be—I figured I would
just work on it. In that particular instance, I didn't get the part.”
But she won many others, and she got by with a lot less worry than many actors experience.
“When I don't get a part, I just try to move on mentally, not dwell on it, get on to the next thing.”
If you're finding yourself getting worried, take on a new project. Learn a new skill. Do something
you believe in. Focus on the needs of others. Getting busy takes your mind off your own troubles.
You'll also be serving others, which will make you feel better about yourself.</p>
<h3>WHAT IF THERE IS GOOD REASON TO WORRY?</h3>
<p>Despite all these fine worry-stopping techniques, you will still have problems in your life. All of
us do. You can accept the inevitable. You can put an ironclad stop-loss order on your worries. You
can remind yourself of what havoc all this worrying can cause.</p>
<p>But still you will have problems, and you will need to deal intelligently with them.
Here's a useful three-step approach. If you'll just follow these three steps, it's amazing how much
more clearly you'll see what you're dealing with.</p>
<p>1. Ask yourself, What's the worst that can possibly happen? Thankfully, most of our problems
are, in fact, not matters of life and death. So maybe the worst that will happen is that you lose an
important account. Or you're late for a meeting. Or your boss yells at you. Or you get passed over
for a promotion you were hoping for. Unpleasant? Absolutely. The cause of untold worry for
millions out there? No doubt. Deadly? Probably not.</p>
<p>2.Prepare yourself mentally to accept the worst, if necessary. This doesn't mean lying back and
welcoming failure. It justmeans telling yourself, Yes, I suppose I could deal with that if I really have
to. And the truth of the matter is that wecan almost always recover—even from “the worst.” It
won't be any fun. There's no reason to pretend otherwise. But at the same time, losing a
promotion or being reprimanded is not quite the end of the world. When we remind ourselves of
this—“Hey, what's the worst that can happen?”—We'll be sure to confront the real issues in a far
less hysterical frame of mind.</p>
<p>3.Then work calmly and methodically to improve upon the worst. Ask yourself, What can I do to
make the situation better? How quickly should I act? who can be of help? After I make that first
move, what are the second, third, fourth, and fifth things I should do? How can I measure the
success of the steps I take?</p>
<p>Patty Adams, a marketing representative for TRW REDI Property Data, Inc., used that three-step
approach in facing the scare of her life. “One day my phone rang,” Adams explains. “It was my
worst nightmare. My doctor wanted me back in his office as soon as possible to rerun and confirm
the test.” Uterine cancer.</p>
<p>“I was devastated by the fear of the unknown,” she says. “Would I lose my femininity, or worse,
my life? A thousand scenarios ran through my head. First things first. I got confirmation of the
awful verdict, and of course, I totally collapsed inside.”</p>
<p>Pulling herself together, she faced her fears and asked her doctor for the worst-case prognosis. It
was “surgery with the loss of ability to have children.”</p>
<p>Her heart sank. “At twenty-seven,” Adams recalls, “I was too young and vital to face such a loss.
But if I didn't go for treatment, I would die.” Before she became hysterical, Adams got the facts.
“This has a ninety-five percent cure rate. At that point I recognized that even if I had the surgery,
I would be no less alive.”</p>
<p>For eighteen months she used drugs to fight the disease—without success. “When surgery was
scheduled, I resigned myself to have faith and not let fear destroy me,” she says. “I put myself in
the mind-set that I could handle anything that life brought.”</p>
<p>She had the surgery. Luckily, with a small loss of tissue, she was cured. “Four years later, I don't
have any signs or irregular cells,” she says. “Every day I face life anew.”</p>
