<h2 align="center">TEAMING UP FOR TOMORROW</h2><br>

	<p><i>Adolph Seltz of Philadelphia, a salesman in an automobile showroom and a student in one of my
courses, suddenly found himself confronted with the necessity of injecting enthusiasm into a
discouraged and disorganized group of automobile salespeople. Calling a sales meeting, he urged his
people to tell him exactly what they expected of him. As they talked, he wrote their ideas on the
blackboard. Then he said, “I'll give you all th</i></p>
<p><i>me what I have a right to expect from you.”
The replies came fast: “Loyalty. Honesty. Initiative-Optimism. Team work. Eight hours a day of
enthusiastic work.”</i></p>
<p><i>The meeting ended with a new courage, a new inspiration—one salesperson volunteered to work
fourteen hours a day—and Mr. Seltz reported to me that the increase in sales was phenomenal.</i></p>
<p><i>“The people had made a sort of moral bargain with me,” said Seltz, “and as long as I lived up to my
part of the bargain, they were determined to live up to theirs. Consulting them about their wishes and
desires was just the shot in the arm they needed.”</i><b>—DALE CARNEGIE</b></p>
<p>It used to be that big organizations were shaped like pyramids. They had many workers on the
bottom and layer after layer of supervisors and middle managers above. Each layer had more
authority than the one beneath it. And this multilayered structure rose ever so neatly to a perfect,
predictable point—where the CEO, the chairman, and the board of directors got to sit.</p>
<p>Was this the best way to organize a company, a hospital, a school? Almost no one ever bothered
to ask. The old pyramid was as it always had been: solid, impressive, and seemingly impervious to
change.</p>
<p>Now this might come as a surprise to some people, but the pyramids are tumbling down. It's as if
the slaves of ancient Egypt decided to return, and they're carting away the stones. The new
landscape may never be as flat as the sandy Sahara. But you can bet the future will be a whole lot
more horizontal than the past.</p>
<p>All those rigid hierarchies, all those departmental lines, all those intricate chains of command —
all of it stifled creative work. And who can afford that when the world is changing so fast?</p>
<p>“Look at what happened to the former USSR as a hierarchy,” says Richard C. Bartlett, vice
chairman of Mary Kay Corporation. “The same thing will probably happen to China because of
hierarchy. It doesn't work for governments. It doesn't work for corporations either. The biggest
corporations we've got in the United States didn't even notice the world coming down around their
ears.”</p>
<p>Clearly what's been needed is a structure that loosens up the old rigidity, that could let people
do their creative best, that could fully develop the talent that's been lying dormant for years. In
more and more well-led organizations, the answer is being found in teams. Increasingly often,
people are being asked to work beyond their disciplines, outside their cultures, above and below
their usual ranks.</p>
<p>“The modern organization cannot be an organization of boss and subordinate,” argues business
theorist Peter Drucker, professor of management at the Claremont Graduate School in California.
“It must be organized as a team.” Andres Navarro, president of Chile's SONDA, S.A., agrees. “The
Lone Ranger is no longer possible,” Navarro observes. “A guy by himself inventing something alone
—the world is too complicated for that. You need several people from different disciplines working
together at the same time.”</p>
<p>Small groups of people, recruited from throughout the organization, brought together for
ongoing projects or for some specific, limited task —to design a new product, to reorganize a plant,
to restructure a department, to figure out how to add momentum to a quality-improvement
program. Fading are the old departmental rivalries. And fading are the automatic promotions, the
seniority-based pay scales, and the other frustrating vestiges of the old pyramid.</p>
<p>In pyramid companies, the engineers spent all day cooped up with other engineers. Now an
engineer might just as easily be thrown into a group of salespeople and told, “Help make this
product more attractive to the customer.” Or “Figure out how to build that part faster.” Or “Use
your engineering expertise to guide this marketing group around a technical glitch.”</p>
<p>As a result of groupings like this, marketing is actually listening to engineering, and engineering is
listening back. At many big companies this never, ever happened before. And now manufacturing,
customer service, labor relations, and all the other far-flung departments are communicating too.
At some progressive companies, these entire artificial divisions are even beginning to disappear.</p>
<p>As Drucker argues, the world is not made up of privates and drill sergeants anymore. “The army
was organized by command-and-control, and business enterprise as well as most other institutions
copied that model,” he writes.“This is now rapidly changing. As more and more organizations
become information’ based, they are transforming themselves into soccer or tennis teams—that is,
into responsibility-based organizations in which every member must act as a responsible decisionmaker.
All members have to see themselves as executives.” Look at how Mary Kay Corporation is
organized. “The Mary Kay organizational structure is a free form,” says Vice Chairman Richard
Bartlett. “I like to think of it almost as a molecular structure, where people can go right through any
artificial barriers. They are not confined to a box. They can participate in a creative action team
right across departmental lines. And in our view of the world —and this sounds trite to say, but a
few people have jumped on the bandwagon since —the customer is right smack on top.</p>
<p>“But in the way we do business, right below her is our sales force. Our organization is very
focused on how to support that sales force. At the bottom of the organizational chart is something
that is referred to as an insignificant green dot.</p>
<p>“The first time I ever did a slide presentation on how to structure an organization, the artist put
a green dot down there,” Bartlett recalls. “I'm the insignificant green dot. My personal view of the
world is that there is no need for a president or chairman unless he is dedicated to serving the
needs of others and to providing resources to the people who are getting the job done.”“Organizations are actually restructuring,” says Adele Scheele, whose articles on careermanagement
issues appear regularly in American and Japanese business magazines. “What used to
work no longer works. People expected there would be a set path, and there is no set path. So the
more you believe in that, the less likely you are to be able to be flexible and begin to take
advantage of opportunities that never come labeled. You want to always be open.”</p>

<p>“Organizations are actually restructuring,” says Adele Scheele, whose articles on careermanagement
issues appear regularly in American and Japanese business magazines. “What used to
work no longer works. People expected there would be a set path, and there is no set path. So the
more you believe in that, the less likely you are to be able to be flexible and begin to take
advantage of opportunities that never come labeled. You want to always be open.”</p>
<p>These flattened organizations are turning up in all kinds of surprising places, even in the
educational world. “Management is becoming a lot flatter,” observes Marc Horowitz, principal of
Cantiague Elementary School in Jericho, New York. “And there's a real need to build teams, lead
teams, and motivate people horizontally. In many cases it has to be done without title, without
financial remuneration or incentive. It's the team's performance that's key.” What this means in
Horowitz's school is that students no longer work by themselves all day long in rows of wooden
desks. They cooperate. They work in teams. They produce group projects. The students are
expected to help each other. The teachers also work more cooperatively than they ever have
before.</p>
<p>“Now it's ‘How do we relate together and get results in the real world?’” Horowitz explains.
“We're preparing students for the future. They really can't work in isolation anymore. They have to
get involved in a team effort, and half of that battle is learning the social skills to encourage those
in the group who aren't doing so well. They should never be allowed to feel less than worthy
because they slip up or they do not have all the answers.”</p>
<p>Three first-graders at Horowitz's school were involved in a group project one day. One of the
children had the task of writing the word two on a piece of paper. But the child misspelled the
word, writing it as tow. When a girl in the group pointed out the error, the boy felt bad for a
moment. But then the little girl said, “Don't worry about it. I know you misspelled it. But that was a
beautiful w, okay?” She even gave him a pat on the knee, and all three of the students got a good
lesson in working cooperatively.</p>
<p>The Harvard business school marketing faculty recently conducted a teamwork experiment with
the first-year graduate students. Instead of the usual midterm case-study exam, these students
were divided at random into teams of four. Each team was given a business problem to solve— and
twenty-four hours to come back with a written plan. The members of each team would get the
same grade.</p>
<p>“Initially there was much criticism,” says John Quelch, the Harvard business school professor.
“Some students complained that individual grades would be adversely affected by the fact that
they were thrown into a team with a group of people they wouldn't have selected to work with.”
The school's answer: Welcome to the real world.</p>
<p>In the end, the Harvard students came around. When the student newspaper surveyed the
students after the experience, they expressed an overwhelming support for the new group-project
midterm exam.</p>
<p>“The most significant level of learning,” Quelch says, “was probably among students in those
groups that did not perform like clockwork. There were some groups which experienced
tremendous disagreements, and in retrospect, those were the students who learned the most out
of the whole process.”</p>
<p>Effective teamwork doesn't happen by magic. It takes a cooperative group of players, and it takes
a talented coach. You can't simply throw a few individuals together—even a few highly talented
individuals —and expect them to perform brilliantly.</p>
<p>That's why the National Basketball Association all-star game so often falls short of its hype. Sure,
the game features many of the finest players in America, brought together on a single basketball
court. Pound for pound, there is no more talented collection of guards, forwards, and centers
anywhere. So why does this floor full of phenomenal talent so seldom produce a phenomenal
game?</p>
<p>Too much ego.Too much time in the spotlight. Too many mornings on the sports page. When it
comes to playing as part of a unit, these superstars often fail to measure up. The missing ingredient
is team-work.</p>
<p>There is an art to building successful teams, and even a great coach can rarely mold a winner
overnight. But anyone who expects to be a leader in the years to come had better master a few
basic coaching techniques. They are as necessary in the business world as they are on the
basketball court.</p>
<h3>CREATE A SHARED SENSE OF PURPOSE.</h3>
<p>People working together can accomplish tremendous things. What gives a team that special
boost is the unifiedvision the individual members share.</p>
<p>vision the individual members share.</p>
<p>The ideas, the creativity, the intelligent sparks will ultimately have to come from the group itself.
But a strong leader is often needed to focus all that energy—to clarify the vision, to establish goals,
to help everyone understand what the team is about, to show the team members how their
accomplishments will impact upon the outside world. Ray Stata, chairman of Analog Devices Inc.,
says, “You've got to provide the environment, the corporate objective, and the encouragement so
that people as individuals and as teams of individuals can feel that they're world-class, that they
are better than any other team, and that there's recognition and feedback which acknowledges
that.”</p>
<h3>MAKE THE GOALS TEAM GOALS.</h3>
<p>Unless the whole team wins, no one wins. This concept is most familiar in the world of sports,
but it's just as true for teams of any sort. Individual records are fine for the history books, but really
they're an afterthought. What matters far more is the performance of the entire team.</p>
<p>“When you get people involved in this way and they feed off each other, it's contagious,” says
Rubbermaid's Wolfgang Schmitt. “It becomes a lot more like being a member of a sports team
versus being in an assembly line. There's just a big difference in the energy level they bring into the
work, the intensity.”</p>
<p>That's why most good coaches —and most good leaders—speak so often in the first-person
plural. “We need ...” “Our deadline ...” “The job before us...” Good leaders always emphasize how
everyone's contribution fits in.</p>
<p>In business: “Together we have to get this new product smoothly to market.” If the ad man does
marvelous work but the packaging specialist fails, that's not success.</p>
<p>In sailing: “Together we have to get this boat through he storm.” If the navigator can read the
stars like a paperback novel but the skipper doesn't know the difference between starboard and
port, that's not success.</p>
<p>In politics: “Together we have to win this election.” If the candidate is a splendid orator but the
advance staff can't get her to the speech, that's not success.</p>
<h3>TREAT PEOPLE LIKE THE INDIVIDUALS THEYARE.</h3>
<p>When individuals come together as a team, their individuality doesn't suddenly evaporate. They
still have different personalities. They still have different skills. They still have different hopes and
fears. A talented leader will recognize those differences, appreciate them, and use them to the
advantage of the team.</p>
<p>Individually— that's how Bela Karolyi, the internationally renowned gymnastics coach, prepared
his students for the Olympic Games. “If I wasn't producing what he wanted,” recalls Olympic gold
medalist Mary Lou Retton, a star student of Karolyi's, “he would ignore me. I'd rather him yell at
me, I swear.” But Karolyi was smart enough to recognize that that approach was exactly what
Retton needed.</p>
<p>“I would do a vault,” she recalls. “I'd put my hands up, and then I'd turn around. He would be
looking down at the next girl, who was ready to go. Oh, I wanted his attention so much. I wanted
him to say, ‘That was good, Mary Lou.’ He would use that to get results out of me, and that would
push me to make the correction, to get that praise.”</p>
<p>Was Karolyi just a grouch? Not at all. With other students he took an entirely different tack.
Retton will never forget the approach Karolyi used on teammate Julianne McNamara. “She has a
much different personality than I do,” Retton says. “She's much more timid, a little reserved. He
would be very gentle with her. If she wasn't makingthat correction, he'd come and put her body
where it needed to be and talk quietly to her. He was always much more gentle with her. That's
how he got personal results.</p>
<p>“He treated each student differently, and I think that's very important.</p>
<h3>MAKE EACH MEMBER RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TEAM PRODUCT.</h3>
<p>People need to feel their contributions are important. Otherwise they'll devote less than
complete attention to the tasks at hand.</p>
<p>Make the project belong to the team. Let as many decisions as possible bubble up from the
group. Invite participation. Don't dictate solutions. Don't insist that things be done a certain way.
The Jaycraft Corporation had a problem. Its biggest customer had a giant order —and a delivery
date that seemed impossible to meet. Doug Van Vechten, the company president, could have
imposed a solution from the top.</p>
<p>But he knew better than to try. Instead, he asked a team of his employees to figure out what to
do. “They came back to me and said, ‘We can move some things around here and there, and we
feel that we can do it, and let's take the job,'” Van Vechten remembers. Jaycraft took the job and
met the customer's delivery demand.</p>
<h3>SHARE THE GLORY, ACCEPT THE BLAME.</h3>
<p>When the team does well and is recognized, it's the leader's responsibility to spread the benefits
around. A public pat on the back, a bonus from the top, a write-up in the company magazine—
whatever form that recognition takes, everyone should get a generous share of it. Denis Potvin,
former captain of the New York Islanders hockey team, knew how to share the glory when his team
won the Stanley Cup. But just in case he didn't, coach Al Arbour knew enough about team play to
remind him. “Make sure you let the other guys carry the cup,” the coach whispered into Potvin's
ear, a few seconds after the final buzzer of the championship game.</p>
<p>“He came on the ice and rushed over to the pile” of celebrating Islanders, Potvin explains. “We're
all congratulating each other. I turned, and Al was there. We both hugged one another. And it was
there, in my ear, that he told me that.</p>
<p>“I was very impressed,” Potvin recalls. “Here is a guy who is in total control of the team. He was
still thinking about his players even though the Stanley Cup had just been won—his first time as a
coach.”</p>
<p>People always appreciate being included in praise. It encourages them to give their greatest
efforts and makes them want to work again with the leader who guided them to this success. And
this kind of gracious-ness has one other benefit: in the end the leader gets a big share of the credit
anyway.</p>
<p>When it comes to criticism, be a smart leader and take exactly the opposite approach. Don't
point the finger at others. Never raise public complaints about the “weak link” in the chain. Step
forward and accept whatever complaints arrive. Then speak privately with the team members
about how the results might be improved, and turn their attention to doing better next time.</p>
<h3>TAKE EVERYOPPORTUNITYTO BUILD CONFDDENCE ON THE
TEAM.</h3>
<p>A great leader will believe firmly in the team and will share that belief with every member.</p>
<p>That's a lesson kindergarten teacher Barbara Hammerman puts into action in her classroom, and
it applies just as well in the factory or boardroom. “I try to build a class spirit within the room,” she
says. “To the children in my class, we are the best class, and there is a feeling that we don't want to
disappoint the group—one for all and all for one—that we have certain standards that are set and
reviewed and continuously reinforced through the year. The children understand these standards.”</p>
<p>They aren't intimidated by them. “They just love living up to these standards because we're
great,” Hammerman said. “Who doesn't want to feel as if they're part of the wonderful group?
When they get compliments from others, they can begin to see the progress they are making and
changes in themselves. And they just feel wonderful about themselves.”</p>
<h3>BE INVOLVED, STAYINVOLVED.</h3>
<p>In those old pyramid companies, it was easy for the boss to remain relatively aloof. After all, that
army of minions was always hovering around, just waiting to distribute the boss's latest wisdom to
the troops</p>
<p>This approach doesn't fly in the new team-based world. The strong leader has to be involved and
stay involved. Visualize the leader as the commander of a busy aircraft carrier, standing out on
deck. Planes are coming in. Others are taking off. The ship has to stay on course and also be
protected from attack. All these considerations have to be factored in together.</p>
<p>The leader really does have to be there. “You've got to have the experience, and you've got to
listen,” says Jack Gallagher, president of North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, New York.
“But after a while, if you get enough experience, if you work hard enough, if you're smart enough, if
you do your homework, then you get a good feel for all these planes going up and down and for all
the other things around you.”</p>

<p>You can't always draw up a precise battle plan. “You've got to get an intuitive feel for it, and
you've got to have antennae out, the antennae in the back of your head,” Gallagher says. “Sure,
there are too many things going on, and this is a very complex business. But you can develop that
intuitive feel.”</p>
<h3>BE A MENTOR</h3>
<p>It's the leader's job to develop the talents and strengthen the people on the team. This is true in
the short term, as the team members deal with their assignment at hand. But it's also true longterm:
the leaders must take a genuine responsibility for the lives and careers of the members of the
team.</p>
<p>“How would you like to improve?” “Where do you want your career to go from here?” “What
kinds of new responsibilities would you like to be taking on?” It's your job as leader to ask all those
questions and to use whatever knowledge and experience you possess to help team members
achieve those goals.</p>
<p>Reinforce the confidence you have in their abilities. Give them standards to live up to. Issue
genuine compliments in public: “Sally has done a terrific job on this report.” Send private notes:
“That was a great comment you made today. You got us all focused where we needed to be.” And
remember, if they succeed, you succeed.</p>
<p>At Harvard University's Graduate School of Business Administration, new faculty members aren't
just left to sink or swim.</p>
<p>“All seven or eight instructors teaching our introductory marketing course meet every week for
four hours as a group to discuss the cases that are coming up and how best to teach those cases,”
says Professor John Quelch. “They also review how the cases went the previous week, what
improvements need to be made, and so forth. In this way, newly recruited instructors can pick up
teaching tips from our more experienced faculty.” The senior faculty members also provide other
kinds of support. Three or four times a semester, one of them sits in on a new instructor's class.
They come to help, not to judge. “They're there very much in a coaching role,” Quelch explains,
“rather than to develop a report for a file that's going to determine your promotion. The goal is to
enhance the effectiveness of the asset—the new faculty member— that we've invested in.”</p>
<p>After class the senior faculty member might provide advice for both short- and long-term
improvement. “What I would try to say to a new faculty member,” Quelch continues, “is, ‘Here are
five things you can do the next time you teach that will have a positive impact on the way you're
received by the class.’ Suggestions might include, for example, something as seemingly trivial as
writing larger on the blackboard. Or ‘Make sure that you don't hang around the blackboard and
direct the class from one area at the front of the room. Wander around the entire room and stand
behind the students. Share the experience.'”</p>
<p>As Walter Lippmann wrote upon the death of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, “The final test of a
leader is that he leaves behind him in other men the conviction and the will to carry on.”</p>
<p>Follow these few simple techniques and watch how your team succeeds. The greatest reward a
leader can achieve—the greatest legacy a leader can leave—is a group of talented, self-confident,
and cooperative people, who are themselves ready to lead.</p>
