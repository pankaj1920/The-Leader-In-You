<h2 align="center">HANDLING MISTAKES, COMPLAINTS, AND CRITICISM</h2><br>


<p><i>Shortly after the close of World War I, I learned an invaluable lesson one night in London. 1 was
attending a banquet given in honor of Sir Ross Smith. During the dinner, the man sitting next to me
told a humorous story which hinged on the quotation, “There's a divinity that shapes our ends, roughhew
them how we will.”</i></p>
<p><i>The raconteur mentioned that the quotation was from the Bible. He was wrong. I knew that. I knew it
positively. There couldn't be the slightest doubt about it. And so, to get a feeling of importance and
display my superiority, I appointed myself as an unsolicited and unwelcome committee of one to
correct him. He stuck to his guns.</i></p>
<p><i>“What?” he thundered at me. “From Shakespeare? Impossible! Absurd!” That quotation was from the
Bible, and he knew it with not one scintilla of doubt.</i></p>
<p><i>The storyteller was sitting on my right and Frank Gammond, an old friend of mine, was seated at my
left. Frank had devoted years to the study of Shakespeare. So the storyteller and I agreed to submit
the question to him. Frank listened, kicked me under the table, and then he said, “Dale, you are
wrong. The gentleman is right. It is from the Bible.”</i></p>
<p><i>I couldn't wait to get Frank alone. On our way home that night, 1 said to him, “Frank, you knew that
quotation was from Shakespeare.” “Yes, of course,” he replied. “Hamlet, act five, scene two. But Dale,
we were guests at a festive occasion. Why prove to a man he is wrong? Is that going to make him like
you? Why not let him save his face? He didn't ask for your opinion. He didn't want it. Why argue with
him?”</i><b>—DALE CARNEGIE</b></p>
<p>Barend Hendrik Strydom was a vicious, cold-blooded killer. Strydom, a white South African, was
angry about the progress blacks were finally making in that land of racial apartheid. So one day in
1988 he decided to do something about it. He sprayed a crowd of black protesters with machinegun
fire, hitting nine men and women, leaving eight of them dead.</p>
<p>He was tried, convicted, and sent off to death row. But even then he didn't seem to think he had
done anything to be criticized about. “To have remorse, one must have done something wrong,” he
said. “I have done nothing wrong.”</p>
<p>When a legal technicality got Strydom's sentence changed from the death penalty to life in jail,
he still didn't seem to understand the public outcry that his crime had caused. “I'll kill again,” he
said. “I have done nothing wrong.”</p>
<p>If such a brutal killer doesn't blame himself for his horrific crime, what about the people most of
us come into contact with every day? Do you think they're eager to admit mistakes or be criticized?
There are two fundamental facts about mistakes. Number one, we all make ‘em. Number two,
we're more than happy to point them out in others, but boy, how we hate it when someone points
out one of ours!</p>
<p>Noel Coward was as thin-skinned about criticism as anyone, but at least he had a sense of
humor. “I love criticism just so long as it's unqualified praise,” the English playwright said.</p>
<p>No one—absolutely no one—likes to be on the receiving end of a complaint, a criticism, or a
rotten review. We allbristle when the finger of responsibility is pointed at us. This is easy enough to
understand. Nothing stings the ego like being told we've made a bad decision or supervised a failed
project or performed below expectations. It's even more difficult when the criticism turns out to be
correct.</p>
<p>But mistakes get made. Arguments arise. Complaints, both legitimate and exaggerated, get
lodged day after day. Customers are unhappy. Nobody is on target all the time. So how do you
handle the knowledge that nobody's perfect but criticism is hard to swallow? With a little practice
and the help of a few time-tested human-relations techniques. Let's not deny the obvious. It's not
always easy keeping both balls in the air. But it's not impossible either. After a while this particular
juggling act can be mastered by almost anyone.</p>
<p>The first step is to create an environment where people are open to receiving advice or
constructive criticism. Spread the word again and again that mistakes are a natural part of life.</p>
<p>One sure way to get this message across is to admit your own mistakes. “Setting the example is
very important. You can't expect from others what you're not willing to expect from yourself.” So
says Fred Sievert of New York Life Insurance Company. Shortly after he arrived at the company,
Sievert had an opportunity to put his ego where his mouth was.</p>
<p>Sievert explains, “I did something here that kind of astounded people. I was off in France at an
executive management school, and we had some critical data that had to be submitted. It was our
five-year plan, and there was a misunderstanding because it was my first time through this. Just
before I left, we submitted the numbers. I was gone for two weeks. Of course, I was in touch via
voicemail and fax. But we submitted the numbers, and there was a major crisis that occurred here.
The problem was that I misunderstood the timing of this submission. I thought the initial
submission was meant to be our first run of the numbers. I thought we then had plenty of time to
analyze and talk about management actions that could be taken to improve the numbers. As it
turns out, I didn't understand the process, and the first set of numbers that were given to the
executive management committee and the chairman were viewed as our version of the plan. I
didn't know that.</p>
<p>“Well, it created a tremendous problem because the numbers weren't good. There were
inconsistencies. There were management actions we hadn't reflected, and I was off in France
sending these voicemails back and forth, not really understanding what had happened but knowing
there was a crisis. I volunteered to come back, but my boss said, ‘No, we got it handled.'“When I got back I realized what had happened. After talking to various people —I know these
people were shocked —I said at a meeting, ‘This is my fault. It's a communication issue. It wasn't a
matter of not understanding the numbers. It was a matter of communication, and it was entirely
my fault.'</p>
<p>“When I got back I realized what had happened. After talking to various people —I know these
people were shocked —I said at a meeting, ‘This is my fault. It's a communication issue. It wasn't a
matter of not understanding the numbers. It was a matter of communication, and it was entirely
my fault.'</p>
<p>“While I was gone, people were pointing the finger at each other. My staff was saying, ‘Why
didn't you guys tell us this was our last shot at this?’ And the other people were saying, ‘You
should have understood this was the last shot.’ Okay, everybody's pointing the finger, and I came in
and stood up and said, ‘This is entirely my fault. I take full responsibility for it. It's a communication
problem. It won't happen again.’ And you know that statement put an end to all the finger
pointing. Several people in the room said, ‘No, no, no, it wasn't your fault. You know it was a
combination of people.'”</p>
<p>Readily admitting fault —it's one of the best ways anyone has ever invented for shifting
momentum when blame is being distributed. Be the first to admit mistakes. Everyone else will rush
to reassure you, ‘No, it's not so bad; no, it doesn't really matter; no, they probably were to blame;
no, it all turned out fine in the end.'</p>
<p>Take the opposite tack —blame other people for something—and just as quickly they'll start to
contradict you, and they'll defend the correctness of their actions. Funny, isn't it, how human
psychology works?</p>
<p>This is true for all relationships—inside a company, a family, or a group of friends. And it's true
in customer or vendor relationships as well.</p>
<p>When a customer is unhappy about a product or the service that's been provided, a quick and
forceful admission of error can often work wonders. That's what John Imlay discovered when he
inadvertently offended an important customer. “Back in 1987,” recalls Imlay, chairman of Dun &
Bradstreet Software, “I had to give a speech on the west coast of the United States to a group of
chief information officers, I guess about a thousand of them. It was out at the Laguna Beach Hotel.
To open it, I was talking about what's in and what out. ‘Noriega's out, democracy's in.’ Things like
that. And the last one was, ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are in, Ken and Barbie are out.’
Everybody laughed except one fellow, one of my key customers. He was the head of Mattel.</p>
<p>“So before I returned to the office, I received a letter. The letter said, ‘I enjoyed your speech, but
you made one statement that I want you to retract forever.’ He went on in a blistering way, finally
summing up by saying the sales of Barbie were more than the revenues of all my companies
combined. So I wrote him a letter apologizing, and I wrote Barbie a letter. He didn't think that was
funny, either.”</p>
<p>Did Imlay give up there? Absolutely not. “For years,” he said, “I took his letter and put it into a
slot, and every speech I gave I reminded the audience how you have to be sensitive to the
customer's issues, and customers absolutely love the slot. I showed the letter, and how I had
gotten it.</p>
<p>“One day I spoke at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York, and the president of Mattel was there. I
gave this speech not knowing he was in the audience. As I spoke, someone passed me a note saying
that the president of Mattel was there. I had him stand up, and he came up and shook my hand.
Then he dropped me a note afterward saying all is forgiven, and he's been a happy customer ever
since.” The lesson here: Admit your mistakes before anyone else has a chance to point them out.
Laugh about them if you can. Never seek to minimize the impact they've had. “A leader has to be
responsible and accountable for his or her own mistakes,” says Fred Sievert. “The worst thing you
can do is to begin to point your finger at everybody else. You've got to take responsibility.” Or as
Andres Navarro says, “If an organization is able to admit mistakes, it's encouraging creativity and
encouraging people to take risks.”</p>
<p>The second step for handling mistakes or problems: Think twice before you criticize or assign
blame. If the person who made the mistake already knows how it happened, why it happened, and
what needs to be done so it won't happen again, then nothing at all needs to be said. There's no
point in making people feel worse than they already do.</p>
<p>Motivated employees want to perform well. G. Curt Jones, senior quality executive at the Federal
Quality Institute, says, “People don't come to work to mess up. They want to feel needed. They
want to be committed.” Business leaders who understand that understand how destructive most
criticism is.</p>
<p>The point is avoiding the blame game, and Ray Stata, the chairman of Analog Devices, Inc., knows
all about it. “The instinctive question when something goes wrong is, ‘Who's to blame?’” Stata
observes. “It's the way the human mind is wired. You want to find somebody to blame and talk
about their mistakes.”</p>
<p>Stata is trying to rid Analog Devices of all unnecessary blame. “One of the things that I'm cutting
out is preaching in the organization,” he said. “We all tend to do it. You know, commiserate, blame,
when things aren't going right. Now, I think one of the little tricks is for me to set the example of
converting complaints into requests and suggestions.”</p>
<p>You have to ask yourself, What am I trying to accomplish here? Says Stata: “At the end of the
day, what you want to do is create effective action that makes the place better. And talking about
who was wrong or what's to blame is not it.” The real goal is to improve the situation.</p>
<p>Jack Gallagher had a major problem on his hands. Gallagher is the president of North Shore
University Hospital, a 755-bed institution affiliated with Cornell University Medical College. As
North Shore grew over the years, the hospital was stuck with the same kitchen that had been
adequate in the days of 169 beds.</p>
<p>When the time finally came to build a new kitchen, Gallagher asked an associate to oversee the
job. He gave the man two pieces of advice: hire a parking consultant and hire a dietary consultant.
“I couldn't follow the project every day,” Gallagher recalls. “And for some reason, he didn't use
the parking consultant. He didn't use the dietary consultant. So we got trapped between the
opening of the new kitchen and the closing of the old.”</p>
<p>By the time Gallagher discovered this, construction was already under way and millions had
already been spent. It was much too late to change the plans. But no one was happy with the
results. The new kitchen was too small, the quality of the food was slipping, and the hospital's
reputation was suffering as a result.</p>
<p>Gallagher could have fired the associate. He could have criticized the man in public. But what
good would that have done? How would a public scolding have improved the lamb chops or the
baked chicken? Would it have made the string beans stay hot?</p>
<p>“You don't want to point a finger and assign blame,” Gallagher says. “What we had to do was fix
the system. We had to make it better. We had to step back and say, ‘How can we improve the
situation?’ Blame wouldn't have gotten us any closer to that.”</p>
<p>Criticism or blame spreading almost always causes people to duck and hide. People who have
been on the receiving end of harsh criticism are far less likely to take risks, to be creative, to go out
on a limb of any kind. Instantly the organization has lost an important part of that employee's
potential.</p>
<p>This concept has found its way into the whole employee-review process at Mary Kay
Corporation. The goal is improvement, not judgment. “We don't call that a performance appraisal,
we call it performance development,” said Mary Kay Vice Chairman Richard Bartlett. Why's that? “I
don't want to sit there and be judgmental,” Bartlett says. “I want to know how I can help you be
better. The big thing is we're sitting down and discussing your career at Mary Kay. How do you need
to develop to be whatever it is you want to be in the future? From your viewpoint.” Now that's the
kind of corporate attitude that invites and encourages employee innovation.</p>
<p>“The people who accept criticism the best are the people who are genuinely interested in selfimprovement,”
according to David Luther, the Corning quality chief. “Sometimes the easiest people
to correct are those who are at the top of the league. They're the people who are going for the
extra five percent and welcome constructive criticism. One of the advantages of the Japanese is
their notion of treasuring errors. They consider the discovery of a mistake or error as a treasure
because it's a key toward further improvement.”</p>
<p>We all agree: almost no one likes to receive it, and far too many people like to give it. Blaming
someone rarely improves the situation.</p>

<p>There are exceptions, of course. Sometimes people do need to be criticized constructively. If the
need is urgent enough, if the danger is severe enough, and if the mistake is made often enough,
then something needs to be said. If after thoughtful consideration, you do decide you have to
discuss a situation, criticize respectfully.</p>
<p>That's step number three. Walk softly and leave the big stick at home. Restrain yourself, follow a
few basic techniques, and you'll ensure that your words are met by open ears. Hi
Create a receptive environment for what you have to say. While people don't ever like to hear
negative things about themselves, they'll be more receptive if you focus on the things they do right
as well as the things they do wrong.</p>
<p>“The process of criticism should begin with praise and honest appreciation,” Dale Carnegie said.
Mary Poppins had much the same thing in mind when she sang, “A spoonful of sugar helps the
medicine go down.”</p>
<p>Andres Navarro at SONDA, S.A., has found a way to institutionalize a kinder, gentler approach to
criticism. In his company there is now a three-for-one rule. Navarro explains, “We try to criticize as
little as we can. We have a rule. If you get into this company and you find someone whom you
don't like and you think doesn't do his work the way he should, don't say anything. Write it down
on a piece of paper. Once you discover three good things about the person whom you're talking
about—or about a policy or a rule or a habit that we have —then you have the right to criticize
one.” That's a great technique.</p>
<p>Another one is using encouragement. Make the faults seem easy to correct. This is the same
principle that is practiced by New York Life's Fred Sievert. He calls it his “sandwich technique” for
giving criticism. “I start by talking about the positive things that the employee has accomplished,”
Sievert says. “Then in the middle we talk about the areas for development and improvement.
Finally we close with a discussion of how valuable the person is to New York Life. It always works. I
had a boss once who did that with me, and I used to walk out of the room scratching my head,
saying, ‘Gee, I really feel good about getting reprimanded.'”</p>
<p>Equally important is knowing what to avoid. Never argue, demean, or shout at someone. If
you're arguing with someone, you've already lost. You've lost control of yourself, you've lost your
perspective, and most significantly, you've lost sight of your goal: to communicate, to persuade, to
motivate. As Dale Carnegie said, “There is only one way under high heaven to get the best of an
argument— and that is to avoid it. Avoid it as you would avoid rattlesnakes and earthquakes. Nine
times out of ten, an argument ends with each of the contestants being more firmly convinced than
ever that he is absolutely right.”</p>
<p>Let the person save face at all costs. This may mean hanging back in a discussion, calling
attention to the person's mistakes indirectly, or asking questions instead of giving orders. Or it may
mean saving some criticism for another day. However you choose to do it, the goal is the same: be
gentle, underplay, don't attack. Even if someone doesn't agree entirely with your point of view,
with enough finesse you may still get that person to see some merit in your position. But if you
come on too strong, if you use words like right and wrong, smart and stupid, you'll never persuade
anyone of anything.</p>
<p>“We do get complaints,” Wolfgang Schmitt of Rubbermaid says. “About half of those complaints
come about as the result of a consumer's buying a product, thinking it's ours, but it's a competitor's
product. So the consumer writes to us. Our policy is simply to write a personal letter and say, ‘We
can understand how You made the mistake because we have these competitors who copy our
products. You made an honest mistake, but we would like for you to see directly the difference in
value. So try one of ours for free.'</p>
<p>“We send them our replacement product for whatever it is they complained about. And we think
that's a wonderful way to communicate very credibly the story of Rubbermaid value.”</p>
<p>Gentle persuasion always works better than screaming and finger pointing. When you need to
remind yourself of this, recall the old Aesop fable about the contest between the wind and the sun.
The wind and the sun argued one day over which was stronger. The wind proposed a contest and,
seeing an old man walking down the street, set the terms of the bet: whoever could get the man to
remove his coat first would win. The sun agreed and the wind went first. The wind blew, harder
and harder, until the gusts 1 almost reached tornado force. But the harder the wind blew, the
tighter the man clutched his coat.</p>
<p>When the wind gave up, the sun had its chance. The sun shone on the man gently, becoming
warmer and warmer until the man, wiping his brow, took off his coat. The sun told the wind its
secret: gentleness and friendliness are stronger than force and fury. The same rule applies to
customers, to employees, to coworkers, to friends.</p>
<p>Dale Carnegie had a student in one of his classes who was a tax consultant. The student,
Frederick Parsons, had a disagreement with an IRS agent about how to classify a nine-thousanddollar
debt. Parsons was arguing that the money was a bad debt that had not been paid and
therefore wasn't taxable income. The agent was equally adamant that it was taxable.</p>
<p>Parsons was getting nowhere. So he decided to try a different approach: “I decided to avoid the
argument, change the subject, and give him appreciation. I said, ‘I suppose this is a very petty
matter in comparison with the really important and difficult decisions you're required to make. I've
made a study of taxation myself, but I've had to get my knowledge from books. You are getting
yours from the firing line of experience. I sometimes wish I had a job like yours. It would teach me a
lot’ I meant every word.”</p>
<p>The result? “The inspector straightened up in his chair, leaned back, and talked for a long time
about his work, telling me of the clever frauds he had uncovered. His tone gradually became
friendly, and soon he was telling me about his children. As he left, he advised me that he would
consider my problem further and give me his decision in a few days. He called at my office three
days later and informed me that he had decided to leave the tax return exactly as it had been
filed.”</p>
<p>What changed the tax inspector's mind? “The tax inspector was demonstrating one of the most
common of human frailties,” Carnegie wrote. “He wanted a feeling of importance. As long as Mr.
Parsons argued with him, he got his feeling of importance by loudly asserting his authority. But as
soon as his importance was admitted and the argument stopped and he was permitted to expand
his ego, he became a sympathetic and kindly human being ”</p>
