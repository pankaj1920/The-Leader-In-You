<h2 align="center">LISTENING TO LEARN</h2><br>

	<p><i>I met a distinguished botanist at a dinner party given by a New York book publisher. I had never
talked with a botanist before, and I found him fascinating. I literally sat on the edge of my chair and
listened while he spoke of exotic plants and experiments in developing new forms of plant life and
indoor gardens. I had a small indoor garden of my own, and he was good enough to tell me how to
solve some of my problems.</i></p>
<p>As I said, we were at a dinner party. There must have been a dozen other guests. But I violated all the
canons of courtesy, ignored everyone else and talked for hours to the botanist.</p>
<p>Midnight came. I said good night to everyone and departed. The botanist then turned to our host and
paid me several flattering compliments. 1 was most stimulating, he said. I was this, and 1 was that.
And he ended by saying I was a most interesting conversationalist.</p>
<p>An interesting conversationalist?</p>
<p>had said hardly anything at all. I couldn't have said anything if I had wanted to without changing the
subject, for I don't know any more about botany than I do about the anatomy of a penguin. But I had
done this: I had listened intently. I had listened because I was genuinely interested. And he felt it.
Naturally, that pleased him. That kind of listening is one of the highest compliments we can pay
anyone. And so I had him thinking of me as a good conversationalist when in reality I had been merely
a good listener and had encouraged him to talk. <b>—DALE CARNEGIE</b></p>
<p>There are two very good reasons to listen to other people. You learn things that way, and people
respond to those who listen to them.</p>
<p>This point sounds so obvious it looks almost silly sitting there in cold, hard type. But it's a lesson
that most of us spend most of our lives forgetting to apply.</p>
<p>Hugh Downs was lucky. The longtime host of ABC's 20/20 program found out about listening early
in his broadcasting career. This was back in the days of radio, when Downs was just getting started
as an on-air interviewer. He witnessed firsthand how a simple failure to listen could trip up one of
his most experienced colleagues.</p>
<p>“He was interviewing a man who had escaped from a Kremlin prison in the thirties,” Downs
recalled. “This guest was telling him how, for months, the prisoners had been trying to tunnel their
way out of there. They'd dug and dug. They'd eaten the dirt. They'd arranged to have a saw
smuggled in. And when they figured their tunnel was outside the prison walls, they began digging
up. It was quite a dramatic story.</p>
<p>“Then this one midnight, they were finally ready to break loose. They had already sawed through
a wooden platform above their heads. But when this one prisoner stuck his head out, he was
shocked by what he saw. ‘When I got up,’ he told the interviewer ‘I realized I was right in the
middle of Josef Stalin's office.'</p>
<p>“And do you know what this interviewer said next?” Downs asked, recalling that long-ago day.
“Do you have any hobbies?”</p>
<p>Not “Are you serious? Josef Stalin's office?” Or “Stalin wasn't working late that night, I hope.” Or
“So tell me, were you tempted to plop down in the butcher's chair and light up one of his cigars?”
Had the interviewer been listening at all, he would have known to ask any number of follow-up
questions the members of his audience undoubtedly had on their minds. But the interviewer's
attention was off somewhere else. All he could manage was that ridiculous non sequitur. And his
listeners were deprived of the climax to a fascinating tale.</p>
<p>“That's a true story,” Downs said. “And I've heard other interviews like that, where the
interviewer just didn't listen. It's amazing what people can miss. It's a part of the business I call the
yeah-well interview.”</p>
<p>The importance of listening doesn't apply just to professional interviewers, of course. It is vital
for anyone, anywhere, anytime, who hopes to communicate with others.</p>
<p>Listening is the single most important of all the communication skills. More important than
stirring oratory. More important than a powerful voice. More important than the ability to speak
multiple languages. More important even than a flair for the written word.</p>
<p>Good listening is truly where effective communication begins. It's surprising how few people
really listen well, but successful leaders, more often than not, are the ones who have learned the
value of listening.</p>
<p>“I don't sit on top of a mountain and get these visions of what we ought to do,” says Richard C.
Buetow, director of quality at Motorola, Inc. “I have to find out from other people. I have to do a
lot of listening.”</p>

<p>Even a great communicator like Buetow, who is expected to articulate and communicate the
Motorola vision just about everywhere he goes, must also know when not to talk. In his words,
“You have to be able to turn off your transmitter and listen—put the receiver on, let other people
articulate ideas, and nurture them.”</p>
<p>This understanding is a central part of Buetow's self-image as a business leader. He never talks
about himself, for instance, as a grand strategist or a sophisticated corporate sage. He compares
himself instead to a carrier pigeon.</p>
<p>“I don't solve one quality problem at Motorola,” he explains. “If you ask me to do hardware, first
thing I'll do is give you the telephone number of the person who is responsible for hardware. What
I do is take the good ideas that I hear and carry them from place to place.”</p>
<p>The underlying truth here is self-evident: No one can possibly know everything. Listening to
others is the single best way to learn.</p>
<p>This means listening to employees, to customers, and to your friends and family—even to what
harshest critics have to say. It doesn't mean becoming a captive of other people's opinions, but it
does mean hearing them out.</p>
<p>You'll be thankful for many of their ideas.</p>
<p>Giorgio Maschietto, managing director of Lever Chile, S.A., the packaged-goods company, was
responsible for running a string of factories in South America, including a giant Pepsodent
toothpaste plant. The factory's production schedule was constantly being interrupted by the need
to wash out the steel toothpaste tanks. One day one of the line operators made a suggestion, and
Maschietto had the good sense to follow through.</p>
<p>“We were using just one tank,” he recalls. “This line employee suggested we should put in a
second tank. Now we can wash the first tank while using the second one, so there's no need to stop
production anymore for tank washing. By adding a bolt in one case and by adding a small tank in
another case, we've reduced changeover time by seventy percent and significantly increased
productivity.”</p>
<p>From the same source—the factory floor—Maschietto got a second toothpaste-production idea
that was just as important. For years the factory had used a set of highly delicate and highly
expensive scales beneath the toothpaste conveyer belt. Their purpose was to make sure each
carton of toothpaste actually contained a tube. But the high-tech scales never quite worked.
“Sometimes,” Maschietto says, “we used to seal up empty cartons and send them out.</p>
<p>“One of the ideas of the men on the line was to replace all this expensive machinery and just put
a small jet of airacross the conveyer belt where the tubes rolled by. The compressed air is regulated
so that when the carton is empty, the pressure of the air is enough to throw the empty cartons off
the belt.”</p>
<p>Many people think of listening as passive, talking as active. Even the cliches people use in
conversation— “sit back and listen"—hint at this pervasive misunderstanding of what true listening
is about. Simply hearing what someone says is a relatively passive activity. But engaged, effective
listening is a highly active sport.</p>
<p>Andres Navarro, president of SONDA, S.A., a South American computer-systems company, uses
his native Spanish language to illustrate the difference between the two. “In Spanish,” Navarro
explains, “we have two words, oir and escuchar,” the rough equivalent of “to hear” and “to listen.”
“To really listen is much more than just hearing. Many people, when they are hearing someone,
they are really thinking to themselves, ‘What will I answer?’ instead of trying to listen to what the
person is saying.”</p>
<p>Active listening requires an intense involvement in a conversation, even when the listener's lips
are still. That isn't always easy. It takes concentration. It requires genuine engagement. It calls for
questioning and prodding. And it demands some kind of response, quick, thoughtful, on target, and
concise.</p>
<p>There are many ways of displaying active involvement in a conversation, ways that don't entail
jumping in and interrupting the other person's every seven words. The trick isn't to master every
one of these techniques. Good listeners learn a few that they find comfortable and natural—and
remember to put these few to work.</p>
<p>It can be an occasional nod, or an uh-huh, or an I see. Some people like to shift their postures or
lean forward in the chair. At appropriate moments, others smile or shake their heads. Strong eye
contact is another way of indicating to your conversation-mate, “Yes, I am listening closely to what
you are telling me.” And when the other person comes to a break in his or her talking, go ahead
and ask a question that follows closely from what was just said.</p>
<p>What's important here isn't the precise listening technique that is chosen. None of these
methods should ever be used in a wooden or rote way. These are just a few approaches that are
worth being mindful of when the moment feels right. They will make the other person happier
about speaking with you.</p>
<p>Elmer Wheeler was driving at much the same idea two generations ago when he wrote in his
seminal book on salesmanship, Sell the Sizzle Not the Steak, “A good listener bends toward you
physically. He leans on you mentally with every word that you utter. He is ‘with you’ every moment,
nodding and smiling at the right times. He listens ‘a little closer.’” This isn't good advice just for
salesmen, Wheeler wrote. “It is a sound rule to follow for social and business success.”</p>
<p>“A person who's actively listening,” says Bill Makahilahila, Director of Human Resources at SGSThomson
Microelectronics, Inc., “is usually the one who is asking questions and then waiting for a
response, as opposed to coming up with an instant solution. Active listening is occurring when the
employee feels and knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that you're not just jumping to
conclusions.”</p>
<p>Makahilahila thinks this is such an important concept that he has even created an Active
Listening Award for SGS-Thomson supervisors who excel at listening. He has come up with a threequestion
test for determining whether someone is listening actively or not:</p>
<p>1. Do you ask questions and wait for an answer? <br>
2. Do you respond quickly and directly to the questions that are asked? <br>
3. Does the other person feel you are listening actively to him or her? Chris Conway, an
insurance company marketing specialist living in Omaha, Nebraska, was a single parent raising two
young boys. He learned how to really listen from his older son.</p>
<p>“Dan belongs to a group of about fifteen teenagers who meet weekly with an older couple just to
discuss current issues and how the young people relate to them,” Conway says. “The couple is
there to facilitate the conversation. I asked Dan how he liked participating in the group.”</p>
<p>The boy spoke in unusually enthusiastic tones. He said he could tell the leaders were genuinely
interested in the group by the way they listened so closely to what the young people said.</p>
<p>“Dan, I listen to you,” the father said.</p>
<p>“I know, Dad,” the boy said. “But you are always making supper, washing dishes, or doing
something else. All you ever say is yes, no, or ‘I'll think about it.’ You don't even listen to me. These
people turn and face me and cup their chin in their hand and really listen.”</p>
<p>For the next five weeks, Chris Conway focused on listening to his two sons. “While I heap the
food on the boys’ plates, I only put a couple of vegetables on mine. Whenever the boys speak, I set
down my fork, turn to them and listen. The result is that I have lost fifteen pounds. And our
suppers have gone from an average of eight minutes to forty-two minutes long.”</p>
<p>A good listening environment—that's where listening begins. It's impossible to ever listen
effectively when fear, anxiety, or nervousness is present. That's why good teachers always make
sure their classrooms are comfortable, hospitable places.</p>
<p>“I know for myself that when I'm nervous about something, I don't listen as well,” says
kindergarten teacher Barbara Hammerman. “I'm concerned with my own being. If the children are
tense and nervous in a classroom, they're not free to listen.” William Savel, retired chairman of
Baskin-Robbins, the worldwide ice-cream and yogurt retailer, was once sent to Japan by the Nestle
Company to run marketing and sales.</p>
<p>“The first thing I did was to visit with a number of U.S. companies that had Japanese
subsidiaries,” he recalls. He learned to speak Japanese. He slept in Japanese hotels. He ate Japanese
food. He did everything he could think of to surround himself with things Japanese.</p>
<p>“The important thing is to listen,” Savel said, “to really listen before you go in and start shooting
your mouth off and telling everybody how smart you are. You've got to learn how dumb you are
first. You have to go in and get to know the people, interact with them, don't put yourself above
anyone else. Get around, talk to everybody, listen very intently, and don't make up your mind too
fast.”</p>
<p>Simply put, People everywhere love to be listened to, and they almost always respond to others
who listen to them. Listening is one of the best techniques we have for showing respect to
someone else. It's an indication that we consider them important human beings. It's our way of
saying, “What you think and do and believe is important to me.”</p>
<p>Strangely enough, listening to someone else's opinions is often the best method of getting them
around to your way of thinking. Dean Rusk, President Johnson's secretary of state, knew this from
decades of negotiating with some of the world's most stubborn political leaders. “Listening is the
way to persuade others with your ears.” It's true; listening can be a tremendously powerful tool for
convincing others to see the world the way that you do.</p>
<p>“The real key,” says merchant banker Tom Saunders, of Saunders Karp & Company, “is getting to
understand a person and what he values and how he wants to look at investments and whether or
not you could honestly say our approach was right and compatible for him.”</p>
<p>Saunders is in the business of advising big corporations about how to invest prodigious sums of
money. His number-one technique? Listening to them. It all “goes back to listening,” he says. “What
was really on his mind? Why had he said no? What was the real reason behind it?</p>
<p>“I've had a twenty-five-year relationship with AT&T, which has just been extraordinary. I think it's
all basically been due to listening.”</p>
<p>Saunders goes on, “I can give you the best-looking brochure. I can throw up all these slides. But
still I've got to find out what's in there that's interesting to that person. What's on this person's
mind? What does he think about? How does he look at things?”</p>
<p>The first step to becoming a strong, active listener is understanding how important good
listening is. The second step is wanting to learn. Finally, you have to practice those budding
listening skills.</p>
<p>“I learned mine in not such a pleasant way,” recalls Wolfgang R. Schmitt, chief executive officer of
Rubbermaid Incorporated, the home-products giant. “I learned mine by going through a divorce
when I was young. I was very career-centered. In the process of trying to avoid the divorce, we went
to a counselor. That was really the first time I understood how crucial good listening is. Here was
something that was important to me —my marriage—and I wanted to try to retrieve it. That was
the first time that somebody said to me some very straightforward things.”</p>
<p>About listening? “Not just listening,” Schmitt says, “but internalizing other people's feelings and
thinking about them. Then being able to mirror them back, so you can demonstrate their
importance to you.”</p>
<p>At Motorola small teams of employees are always encouraged to come in with their ideas. And
the company's top executives sit quietly and listen. “I've sat and listened to hundreds of teams tell
me about all these issues and solutions and so on,” Motorola's Richard Buetow says. And it is out
of those hundreds of conversations that Motorola's future has been built.</p>
<p>Those kinds of small group-discussions —hosted by executives who mostly keep their mouths
shut —are a tremendously valuable way to institutionalize corporate listening. At Analog Devices,
Chairman Ray Stata has created a technique he calls the CNA Roundtable. Meetings are held
regularly. Small groups of employees from throughout the company are invited to sit down for noholds-
barred discussions with Stata and other top Analog executives. The general theme is
“creating a new Analog for the ‘90s,” or CNA, the company's internal slogan these days.</p>

<p>“It's not just a matter of answering the questions people ask,” Stata explains. “What I do after a
certain amount of discussion is I'll say, ‘Now what I'd like to do is go around the table and have
each individual tell me, What are your particular concerns right now? What are your suggestions?
Where are you coming from?’ And I sit there and take copious notes.</p>
<p>“That's called listening,” he says. “Afterwards, I write a memo that summarizes what I heard.”</p>
<p>Joe Booker took a new job as the leader of a quality-improvement program at the Allegheny
Ludlum Corporation, an import-export company in the steel business. Quickly his enthusiasm
turned to fear. “The program had been in existence at the company's largest plant for about
eighteen months, with poor acceptance by the plant's nearly two thousand employees. Since
participation was voluntary, how would I get the departments to realize the need for quality
improvement? In many cases they were already successful in using their own techniques.”</p>
<p>After some thought, Booker realized that what he needed to do was convince the employees
that he was a competent team player who would be an asset to them. What this meant, he
realized, was some hard-core listening. “I began to visit each one of the plant's six departments
with the goal of understanding how individuals felt about their products’ quality,” he says. “I
avoided arguments about the program and guided each conversation to hear how that individual
was key to the progress of quality improvement. I was able to find allies in each of the departments
and with their aid encourage others to get involved in the challenge to meet world-class quality.</p>
<p>“Today our plant has the highest union-represented involvement in any of the company's
finishing facilities. People understand how the next operation or department is their customer. This
is a direct result of good listening and communication among all employees.”</p>
<p>David Luther at Corning has discovered exactly that same rule. “One of the first questions I ask
when I look at a communication plan is, How long does it take before you see the word listen?
Most of these plans are full of ‘Let me tell you this’ or ‘Let me tell you that and the other thing.'”</p>
<p>At Corning, Luther developed a process for turning listening into a practical improvement tool.
He explains how that process works. “We'll call over to a factory. I want two groups of fifteen
people, and I want them for five hours. And we'll come in. Usually there's the union head, he has
an assistant, and I have an assistant. One of the union people and I will take one group of fifteen.
My assistant and the other union person will take the other fifteen. So we have two people in front
of each group.</p>
<p>“We take them through a process. The first thing we say is, ‘What's right about quality?
Remember what it used to be like here ten years ago. Can you think about how quality is better
now? Okay, let's put that on the wall.'</p>
<p>“Second part: ‘What isn't right about quality? The only thing you can't complain about is your
boss. Everything else is fair.’ And we put that on the wall.</p>
<p>“Then we'll take that second list and condense it to ten or twelve issues. There's always a little
overlap. We want to get rid of the overlap. ‘Now we're going to vote. We've got twelve items here.
You've each got three votes, and as I point to each of these twelve items here, if that's one of your
more important quality issues, raise your hand.'</p>
<p>“As you go through the list of twelve, six don't get any votes at all, a couple will get a few votes,
and maybe two will go right off the chart. So let's talk about those complaints. “Then you take the
two groups. You put them back together. You bring in the plant management. You have a
spokesperson for each group get up and say, ‘Here's what my group said.’ So the first group says,
‘We don't understand what the plant manager thinks.'</p>
<p>And the second group gets up and says, ‘The plant manager never communicates to us.’ Even the
dimmest plant manager will understand that he or she has got a major issue there and it's
transparent. You can see the whole thing. It develops right there with his or her people. And there
is no sending away questionnaires and rating them or coming back. I mean it's happened right
before your eyes and you saw the coincidence. You know each of these teams did not know what
the other team was saying. Now, we've done this maybe fifty times.”</p>
<p>the other team was saying. Now, we've done this maybe fifty times.”
These are all wonderful techniques. Many others have been developed inside well-led
companies. Remember, the same two basic principles underlie them all:</p>
<p>1.Listening is still the best way to learn. <br>
2.People respond to those who will listen to them.</p>
<p>The simple truth of the matter is that people love being listened to. It's true in the business
world. It's true at home. It's true of just about everyone we come across in life.</p>
<p>“The secret of influencing people lies not so much in being a good talker as in being a good
listener,” Dale Carnegie wrote. “Most people trying to win others to their way of thinking do too
much talking themselves. Let the other people talk themselves out. They know more about their
business or problems than you do. So ask them questions. Let them tell you a few things.</p>
<p>“If you disagree with them, you may be tempted to interrupt. But don't. It's dangerous. They
won't pay attention to you while they still have a lot of ideas of theirs crying for expression. So
listen patiently and with an open mind. Be sincere about it. Encourage them to express their ideas
fully.”</p>
<p>They will never forget. And you will learn a thing or two.</p>
