	<h2 align="center">CONCLUSION</h2>
	<h3>MAKING IT HAPPEN</h3>
	<p><i>Dealing with people is probably the biggest problem you face, especially if you are in business. Yes,
and that is also true if you are a housewife, architect, or engineer. Research done under the auspices
of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching uncovered a most important and
significant fact—a fact later confirmed by additional studies made at the Carnegie Institute of
Technology. These investigations revealed that even in such technical lines as engineering, about 15
percent of one's financial success is due to one's technical knowledge and about85 percent is due to
skill in human engineering—to personality and the ability to lead people.</i><b>—DALE CARNEGIE</b></p>
	<p>Look out the window. Notice how much change has occurred out there in just the past few years.
The postwar boom went bust. Competition became global. Consumers grew more sophisticated.
Quality became an expectation. Whole new industries were born, and others were realigned. Some
dried up and blew away. The idea of two military superpowers now seems like ancient history.</p>
	<p>The Eastern Bloc fell apart. Europe is growing more unified by the day. The Third World
countries are trying to elbow their way onto the economic stage. Most of the cushiness has gone
out of modern capitalism—and with it the blessed stability that generations of business people
had come to expect.</p>
	<p>Did Dale Carnegie anticipate every one of these changes? Of course not. No one could have in a
world changing so fast.</p>
	<p>But Carnegie did something even more important. He left behind a timeless set of humanrelations
principles that are just as relevant today as they ever were. And as things turned out, they
are uniquely suited to the current high-stress, fast-moving, uncertain world.</p>
	<p>Look at things from the other person's perspective. <br>
Offer genuine appreciation and praise. <br>
Harness the mighty power of enthusiasm. <br>
Respect the dignity of others. <br>
Don't be overly critical. <br>
Give people a good reputation to live up to. <br>
Keep a sense of fun and balance in your life.</p>
	<p>Three generations of students and business people have benefited from this essential wisdom.
More people are benefiting every day.</p>
	<p>The timelessness of Carnegie's principles should come as no surprise. They were never rooted in
the realities of any particular moment, realities that are guaranteed to change and change.
Carnegie tested his principles too long and hard for that. Fads would come and go over the years.
Stocks would rise and fall. Technology would accelerate ahead. Political parties would win and lose.
And the economic pendulum would swing like a hypnotist's watch—good times, bad times, good
times, bad times ...</p>
	<p>But Carnegie's insights were solid. They merely needed to be applied. They were built around
basic facts of human nature, so their essential truth never waned. They worked when the world
was humming along. In this new era of constant change, they work just as well. Only now the need
for Carnegie's principles—for anything that works —is greater than it's ever been.</p>
	<p>So apply these basic lessons and techniques. Make them part of your daily life. Use them with
your friends, family, and colleagues. See what a difference they can make.
The Carnegie principles don't require an advanced degree in human psychology. They don't call
for years of reflection and thought. All they take is practice, energy, and a real desire to get along
better in the world.</p>
	<p>“The rules we have set down here are not mere theories or guesswork,” Dale Carnegie said
about the principles he spent his life teaching to millions. “They work like magic. Incredible as it
sounds, I have seen the application of these principles literally revolutionize the lives of many
people.”</p>
	
	<p>So take those words to heart, and find the leader in you.</p>
