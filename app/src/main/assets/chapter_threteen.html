<h2 align="center">ACHIEVING BALANCE</h2><br>


<p><i>The United States Army has discovered by repeated test: that even young men —men toughened by
years of arm\ training—can march better and hold up longer if they throw down their packs and rest
ten minutes of every hour. So the army forces them to do just that.</i></p>
<p><i>Your heart is just as smart as the U.S. Army. Your heart pumps enough blood through your body every
day to fill a railway tank car. It exerts enough energy every twenty-four hours to shovel twenty tons of
coal onto a platform three feet high. It does this incredible amount of work for fifty, seventy, or
maybe ninety years. How can it stand it? Dr. Walter B. Cannon of the Harvard Medical School
explained it to me. He said, “Most people have the idea that the heart is working all the time. As a
matter of fact, there is a definite rest period after each contraction. When beating at a moderate rate
of seventy pulses per minute, the heart is actually working only nine hours out of the twenty-four. In
the aggregate, its rest periods total a full fifteen hours per day.”</i></p>
<p><i>During World War II, Winston Churchill, in his late sixties and early seventies, was able to work
sixteen hours a day, year after year, directing the war effort of the British Empire. A phenomenal
record. His secret? He worked in bed each morning until eleven o'clock, reading reports, dictating
orders, making telephone calls, and holding important conferences. After lunch he went to bed again
and slept for an hour. In the evening he went to bed once more and slept for two hours before having
dinner at eight. He didn't cure fatigue. He didn't have to cure it. He prevented it.</i></p>
<p><i>Because he rested frequently, he was able to work on, fresh and fit until long past midnight.</i><b>—DALE CARNEGIE</b></p>
<p>Monsignor Tom Hartman has been a priest for more than twenty years. His whole life is dedicated
to the service of God and others. His days consist of consoling the needy, ministering to the sick,
advising the distraught, and trying to bring people closer to God. But one thing was sadly missing
from the monsignor's busy days.</p>
<p>One morning his father phoned at the rectory. In those days Hartman was assigned to St. James
Parish in Seaford, Long Island. His father owned a liquor store down the road in Farmingdale. In all
his years of growing up and in all his time as a priest, Hartman could never remember his parents
saying anything negative about him. But on the phone that morning, his father's voice had a
slightly irritated tone.</p>
<p>“Tom, I'd like to sit down and talk with you about something,” his father said.</p>
<p>“Sure,” Hartman told him, and the two men made a date.</p>
<p>When they finally got together, his father spoke immediately about what was on his mind.
“Tom,” he said, “your mother and I admire you. We're always hearing about the good work you are
doing, and we're very proud of you. But I think you're overlooking your family. I understand you've
got to help a lot of people in your life, but many of those people are going to come and go. Your
family will always be there for you. And what's happened is, when you call us, you're always asking
us to do something for you. You just seem too busy to take the time to talk.”</p>
<p>Hartman was momentarily taken aback. “Well, Dad,” he said, “when I was growing up, I watched
you. You were in the produce business working seventy hours a week. And I have to say I admired
you. So you know, I've tried to do the same.”</p>
<p>But his father didn't sound convinced. “What you don't see, Tom, is that your work is harder
than mine was,” he said. “Mine was physical. It was fruit and produce. And then I would come
home and be present with my family.” Hartman didn't know what to say, and he felt relieved when
his father said he wasn't really looking for any instant response. “I just want you to think about
this,” his father said.</p>
<p>Hartman was disturbed enough by the conversation to cancel the rest of his appointments for
the day. Then he decided to call his brothers and sisters. He described later what he discovered on
the phone. “When I called them,” he said, “we were into the conversation about three or four
minutes, and every one of them said almost the exact same thing: ‘What do you want?’ That's
when I had to admit that my father was right.”</p>
<p>Even a man whose calling is to maintain perspective and balance needed to have someone
remind him that—in one part of part of his life, at least—he wasn't practicing what he preached.
That's a mistake everyone makes from time to time.</p>
<p>It is vital for all of us to balance out our lives, to make room for things other than work. This
won't only produce happier and more satisfying personal lives. Almost inevitably, it will also make
people more energetic, more focused, and more productive at work.</p>
<p>Walter A. Green, the chairman of Harrison Conference Services, likens a balanced, productive life
to a “several-legged stool.” Too many people, Green believes, have only a single dimension to their
lives. They are focused round the clock on their careers.</p>
<p>"In my experience, all too often, this one-dimensional perspective continues throughout one's life,”
Green says. “What I would urge is that your life be a several-legged stool, with a dimension for your
family, another for your friends, your avocations, your health. I have seen many examples of
people in their thirties, forties, and fifties whose professions or careers did not materialize as they
had expected. This spells trouble for those whose lives have been a one-legged stool.”</p>
<p>This is a problem even for highly successful people. “At some stage in your life,” Green continues,
“you will want something else. It is possible to begin to develop friendships and interests after
middle age. But watch a fifty-year-old learn to ride a bicycle for the first time!” It's not a graceful
sight.</p>
<p>The importance of balance-to individuals and to the companies that employ them—is only now
being fully understood. But well-led companies everywhere are trying to help their people put true
balance into their lives.</p>
<p>At the New York City headquarters of Tiger Management Corporation, a worldwide moneymanagement
firm, a fully equipped workout room has been installed right outside the president's
office. All Tiger employees are encouraged to use it.</p>
<p>“The gym is going to be tripled in size,” Tiger president Julian H. Robertson, Jr., says proudly. “I
find the young people all seem to come here after work. The fact that they are here rather than at
health clubs all over the city is a tremendous boon for us. They are talking with each other. They
are exchanging ideas. All that is really good for us.” And obviously it's good for them too —
physically and mentally.</p>
<p>“I don't think it's possible to be a great manager or a great executive without being a total
person,” says Andres Navarro, president of SONDA, S.A., a Chilean computer-systems company that
does business in North and South America. Navarro has an apt analogy. “If you want to be an
athlete, maybe to throw the javelin, it's not enough to have the strongest arm. You need the whole
body to be strong.”</p>
<p>And if you want to be a great leader, you need all parts of your life to be strong and intact. “You
see,” explains Navarro, “a good executive who makes great decisions and makes money in the
company but doesn't get along with his wife, his children, and other people in general is missing a
crucial part of life. If you want to grow and be a good leader, you've got to be a complete man—or
a complete woman. And the most important part of it is your family.”</p>
<p>Richard Fenstermacher of the Ford Motor Company promotes the very same idea among his
employees. “We tell our people, ‘Your lives are two-dimensional,'” Fenstermacher says. “If you find
all of your identity at Ford, that's going to be a problem because you have a responsibility to your
family as well.”</p>
<p>Undeniably, most modern leaders don't achieve a perfect balance all of the time. The many balls
that are being juggled aren't easy to keep aloft. The usual tendency for ambitious people is to put
the business first. It just seems so much more urgent, so much more pressing, so much more
crucial.</p>
<p>Fred Sievert at New York Life has a different set of pressures on his time, but he admits candidly
that he too finds it hard to manage all the competing interests in his life. “I'm struggling every day
to bring balance into my life,” he says. “I could literally spend all my waking hours at work and a
year from now not know everything I'd like to know. It's very difficult.”</p>
<p>Yes, it is. Attaining a reasonable division of time between work and leisure “is the greatest
challenge,” believes Ray Stata, of Analog Devices, Inc. But it's worth the effort to master the
challenge.</p>
<p>John B. Robinson, Jr., of Fleet Financial Group, Inc., has realized the benefits that come with
having a happy home life. “There has never been any doubt in my mind what's most important to
me,” says Robinson. A big title? Salary? Stock options? A country home? “What's most important to
me, long-term, is myself, my wife, and my family.”</p>
<p>What does this mean in practice? “I try to keep a sense of what's fair and what's equitable, and if
I've been giving too much to the job and not enough to the family, I say, ‘I'm not going to do that.
I'm not going to say yes to that dinner, and I'm not going to shortchange my family life.'”</p>
<p>Most people, if they were asked directly, would probably echo Robinson's sentiments. Family is
more important. Time to play is essential. But most people don't put that concept into action. They
don't treat balance as a top priority. They fall into the habit of responding to the immediate
pressure of work and ignoring the immediate and long-term pleasure that flows from having a
satisfying personal life.</p>
<p>After his revelation about his family life, Monsignor Tom Hartman taught himself how to “waste”
time. “I try in my life for an hour a day to do nothing,” Hartman explains. “I waste time with God,
with people, with nature, my job. It has transformed my eyes. Now I see the connection we have to
each other. It is so important not to force things but to appreciate them.” Appreciate your family,
your friends, your environment, yourself, whatever it is that gets your mind off work.</p>
<p>At Michael and Nancy Crom's home outside San Diego, Saturdays are always reserved for that. As
Nancy grabs a few last minutes of sleep, Michael and daughter Nicole make pancakes, Nicole's
favorite meal. The two of them go out to the garden, where they check on the strawberry plants,
water the flowers, and feed the birds. He tells her stories from the life of Nicky-Nicole and Belinda
Mcintosh, the make-believe characters the two of them have invented.</p>

<p>“We do that every Saturday, whether I've been traveling or I've been in the office,” Michael says.
“Watching the joy in her eyes keeps me joyful too.”</p>
<p>Wolfgang Schmitt of Rubbermaid takes a walk with his family most nights. “It would be unusual if
we didn't go out for a walk,” Schmitt explains. “If our older sons are there, they go with us. The
little guy always goes with us because he lives at home. We go out for forty minutes, an hour,
whatever, just walking around. We do it no matter what the weather.”</p>
<p>Schmitt also makes a point of spending time alone. “Just physically doing something is therapy.
Raking leaves, cutting wood, planting trees. Any chore is therapeutic.”</p>
<p>Bill Makahilahila at SGS-Thomson makes time for himself every day—even though it means
getting up at three o'clock in the morning. Makahilahila explains his practice of predawn rising: “I'm
busy all day. I'm usually here until seven or eight in the evening, and I know I need to be here in
the morning. I don't know why, but I've just gotten to the point where I am in deep meditation in
the mornings. It's so quiet, I can stretch myself, be creative, read, or reflect on my day.”</p>
<p>The benefits are immediate. “When I've done that,” he says, “I begin to have peace of mind and
self-confidence, even in the midst of the deepest problems that I know I'm going to have to face
that day.”</p>
<p>Coming's David Luther runs. He also vacations with his wife and son four times a year, skiing or
beachcombing. He makes sure he reads things that have nothing to do with work, and when all else
fails, “I just go out and sit on the deck and watch the hawks.”</p>
<p>Once you've analyzed how to enjoy your leisure time, bring some of that same spirit into work.
Who ever said the office has to be a depressing place?</p>

<p>Certainly not Richard Fenstermacher of the Ford Motor Company. Fenstermacher recalls doing
business with a company that brought that spirit of levity right into the executive suite. “When
they bring somebody on the board,” explains Fenstermacher, “they give the new person a Mickey
Mouse watch. There's a big presentation out of the office. Everybody comes and stands around,
and somebody gives a speech. The thing is, you don't have to spend twenty-five years with this
company to get a watch. Here's your watch. When you look at that watch, we want to remind you
to have fun when you work. That's why it's Mickey Mouse.”</p>
<p>Tom Saunders makes enjoyment a high priority at his international merchant bank, Saunders
Karp & Company. “We waste time. When we've got a little bit of time to sit around, we laugh at
each other about something or make fun of each other. I make fun of them all the time and they
make fun of me worse. But all the time I'm ragging them, all the time. We have good times. We
don't take ourselves too seriously.”</p>
<p>Television newsman Hugh Downs has borrowed Churchill's time-tested method of workday
relaxation and given it his own special spin. “The one thing I have in common with great people—
only one thing— is that I can sleep for very short periods and be refreshed,” says Downs. “I can sit
down in a chair and go to sleep for three minutes, five minutes, and wake up and it's like I've had a
night's sleep. I would go into my dressing room often when I was otherwise all ready and say,
‘Wake me two minutes before air time,’ And they'd come in and wake me two minutes before air.
I'd go out and do the show.</p>
<p>“My wife laughs at that,” Downs continues. “She says, ‘If you were condemned to death in two
hours, you're going before the firing squad in two hours, you'd take a nap the first hour and face
the problem the second hour.’ It's probably true. If there were nothing I could do about it in that
first hour, it would be appropriate to take a nap.”</p>
<p>What is always appropriate—at the office, at home, on the road, wherever you happen to find
yourself—is to keep real balance in your life. As Fleet Financial's John Robinson says, “There are
many ways of getting involved in outside activities. Every time you get involved in outside interests,
it adds balance— whether it's church-related, civic-related, or school-related. I just try to avoid
extremes, I guess.”</p>
<p>Singer-songwriter Neil Sedaka had two close friends growing up in Brooklyn, a young couple who
had great ambition in their lives but also just loved to have a good time. Over the years they both
achieved tremendous professional and financial success, but they lost something along the way. It
was the balance they once knew in their lives. Sedaka wrote a song about his friends, which turned
into a giant hit. The song was called “The Hungry Years.”</p>
<p>“They struggled to hit the top,” Sedaka recalls. “Success and money. But when they finally did it,
they discovered that they missed the times when they were just getting started, when they were
hanging out in the old neighborhood, when they were building a life together.</p>
<p>“It's like, ‘I want that five-million-dollar home.’ But then you finally hit it, you actually get to
move in, and after a couple of months, you say, ‘Is this all? Is this it?’ You miss those years that you
did things together. You've lost some of the pleasure and balance in your life.” There's nothing
wrong with material success, but that alone is not enough to sustain a happy life.</p>
<p>How can you start balancing your life? The first step is to change your attitude. You've got to
stop thinking of time for your family, for exercise, or for leisure as wasted time. Achievers often feel
they need to apologize for leisure time. Try to rid yourself of that thought. Relaxation is not a dirty
word.</p>
<p>This leads to the second step in the process: you have to make time for leisure activity. Most of
us are overcommitted. Perhaps it's time to reevaluate priorities. Make a decision to devote as much
energy to planning your leisure time as you devote to planning your workday.</p>
<p>The third step is to act. Do something. Get involved in activities that are not work-related. They
will leave you happier, healthier, more focused, and as a result, a better leader.</p>
