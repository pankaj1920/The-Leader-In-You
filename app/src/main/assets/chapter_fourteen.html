<h2 align="center">CREATING A POSITIVE MENTALATTITUDE</h2><br>


<p><i>I was asked once on a radio program to tell in three sentences the most important lesson I ever
learned. That was easy. “The most important lesson I have ever learned,” I said, “is the stupendous
importance of what we think. If I knew what you think, I would know what you are, for your thoughts
make you what you are. By changing our thoughts, we can change our lives.”</i></p>
<p><i>I now known with a conviction beyond all doubt that the biggest problem you and I have to deal with
—in fact, almost the only problem we have to deal with—is choosing the right thoughts. If we can do
that, we will be on the high road to solving all our problems. The great philosopher who ruled the
Roman Empire, Marcus Aurelius, summed it up in eight words, eight words that can determine your
destiny: “Our life is what our thoughts make it.”</i></p>
<p><i>Yes, if we think happy thoughts, we will be happy. If we think miserable thoughts, we will be
miserable. If we think fear thoughts, we will be fearful. If we think sickly thoughts, we probably will be
ill. If we think failure, we will certainly fail. If we wallow in self-pity, everyone will want to shun us and
avoid us.</i></p>
<p><i>Am I advocating a Pollyanna attitude toward all our problems? No. Unfortunately, life isn't that
simple. But I am advocating—in the strongest of terms —that we assume a positive attitude instead
of a negative one.</i><b>—DALE CARNEGIE</b></p>
<p>Denis Potvin was the most hated man in Madison Square Garden. From the moment he skated
onto the ice that night, the New York Islanders’ captain was assaulted with a roar of boos. And
that's not all he was assaulted with.</p>
<p>Madison Square Garden was the home arena for the Islanders’ archrivals, the New York Rangers
hockey team. Potvin's power on the ice, his outspoken personality, and his pyrotechnic skating style
had turned him into the player that Ranger fans most loved to hate.</p>
<p>“It got so bad my teammates didn't know what to do,” Potvin recalls. “In the dressing room
before we went out, a few of them would try to say, ‘Well, let's go out and beat them tonight.’ You
could see people starting to say something. Then they'd just be quiet. What do you say to a guy
who is the most hated person in the building for the next two and a half hours?” Most of Potvin's
fellow Islanders said nothing.</p>
<p>“I remember one night, standing on the blue line right before the game began,” he says. “In
those days, they used to dim the lights for the National Anthem. They would bring out a singer and
put a spotlight on the singer and the flag.” They don't do that before hockey games at Madison
Square Garden anymore. That night is the reason why.</p>
<p>“I was standing there,” Potvin recalls. “I had taken my helmet off like I always did. And the fans
started throwing things. I heard something go by my ear. It sent shivers right through my body. I
didn't know what it was, but I was scared. I was really, really scared. When the lights came back up,
I skated over and looked. It was a nine-volt battery, one of those big round ones, hurled from
somewhere up above.” It could easily have hit Potvin in the head.At that moment this hockey titan
had a choice. He could let himself become overwhelmed by all the hostility. There were literally
thousands of people shouting their hatred at him. He could let the fear and anger chase him off the
ice, or he could play in front of this angry and possibly dangerous crowd.</p>
<p>Potvin chose to play. He stood up to the arena full of hostility and turned those cowardly threats
into a personal challenge. He fed off all that negative energy and used it to fuel an incredible,
positive strength. All of this was accomplished right in Denis Potvin's mind.</p>
<p>“It was almost a blessing,” he says, looking back on that hostile night. “I played very well in the
Garden that night. And from that point on, I always played very well in the Garden. I was motivated
beyond belief because the only way I could answer these people was by winning in the Garden.
“When I had the puck, they'd boo me. When I shot the puck in the net, they'd boo me. When I
hit a player, they'd boo me. And I started to love it. I really did. All of a sudden, it became
something bigger than me. And Madison Square Garden was the only place in the whole National
Hockey League where, the minute I walked into the building, I was ready to play.</p>
<p>“There was Goliath, and here I was, little David, sitting on the middle of the ice. But I was more
in control than anybody in that building. I was going to exercise that control. I would play my heart
out in the Garden every time.”</p>
<p>Mental attitude. The power we hold in our heads. The way reality can be changed dramatically
by a single, solitary thought.</p>
<p>It sounds a little hard to believe. “Think happy thoughts, and you will be happy. Think successful
thoughts, and you will succeed.” Or from the ice at Madison Square Garden, “Convert that huge
wall of hostility into a source of positive strength.” Did Dale Carnegie and Denis Potvin go skating
off the deep end together? Hardly. Both of them knew the power of attitude. The old expression
had it wrong: it isn't what you eat that determines what you are. You are what you think.</p>
<p>Contrary to what most people want to believe, outside influences do not usually determine
personal happiness. What matters is how we react to those influences, good or bad.</p>
<p>Marshall and Maureen Cogan achieved great financial and professional success. He was a partner
at a big New York investment-banking firm. She was a rising star in the publishing business, who
would become editor-in-chief of Art & Auction magazine. Their three children were all in private
school and doing well. The Cogans had a beautiful co-op apartment in the city, and they had just
built a summer home in East Hampton. It was a big, modern place near the ocean, and people
came literally from around the world to see this unusual home. The house won several architecture
and design awards. It was featured in more than one national magazine. And the Cogan children
seemed to love that house as much as their parents did.</p>
<p>Then trouble arrived. Marshall, who had been growing bored at the investment firm, decided to
strike out on his own. Despite his high expectations and the encouragement of his colleagues and
friends, Marshall's new business never really got off the ground. His timing turned out to have been
miserable —right at the start of a recession. Almost overnight, the business Marshall had sunk all
his savings in was worthless, and the income he was expecting had disappeared. All this bad luck
was topped off by one final blow: just at the most crucial point of his struggles to keep the business
afloat, Marshall came down with hepatitis, which confined him home to bed for more than a
month.</p>
<p>Marshall's bankers were full of personal empathy, but they wouldn't budge an inch in their
demand: “You'll have to sell the new house.” He couldn't stand the idea. It was hard to break the
news to his wife. He had no idea how she—or the children—would react. He needn't have worried.
“Then we'll sell the house, that's it,” said Maureen.</p>
<p>So the Cogans sold their house, along with every last piece of furniture in it. All they would have
to do was pack their clothes, collect the children's toys, turn out the lights, and lock the door.
“Look, we should take the kids out to the house,” Maureen told Marshall the day before the new
owners were set to arrive. “We can give each one of them a big trash bag to put all their toys in,
and we can bring all that stuff back to the city.”</p>
<p>Marshall wasn't so sure. “I don't want the children to see it,” he said. “I don't want them to be a
part of this. You and I will do it.”</p>
<p>“No way,” Maureen told him. “They're going to come. They're going to see what it is to be down.
They're going to understand, because they're going to watch you come back, and they're going to
understand that if that happens to them one day, they can come back too.”</p>
<p>So the parents agreed. Everyone piled into the car, and they rode out to East Hampton. The
children cleaned out their rooms, while the parents collected the clothes and a few other personal
effects. When it came time to leave, they all stood together for a moment on the front steps of the
house, and then Marshall locked the door.</p>
<p>Then the five of them climbed back in the car for the drive to the city. That's when Maureen
spoke quietly to Marshall. “We'll put this in perspective,” she said. “So we're not going off to the
Caribbean. So we're not running off to our house in East Hampton. Life will go on.”</p>
<p>And then she talked to the kids as well. “No, we don't have our house,” she said. “But we have a
nice apartment. We're together. Daddy's healthy, and he's going to start a new business.
Everything's going to be fine.”</p>
<p>It was. The children didn't have to change schools. They even made it to summer camp that year.
Soon enough, Marshall was back in business and doing well. More important than all of that, a
lesson had been learned, a lesson that showed up again almost twenty years later.</p>
<p>Explains Maureen, “My oldest son had a failure. He started a business that we had to close down
so it would not go into bankruptcy. It was a tough, public failure for him, and he was very young,
just twenty-five, I remember saying to him, ‘How are you doing?’ And he said, ‘It's awful. I've got a
few more months before I'm closed.’ He didn't want to go bankrupt; he wanted to pay off his debts,
close the business, and leave.</p>
<p>“But then he said, ‘I remember the time it happened to Daddy, and I'll be fine. I will get through
this. I know I can do this because I watched, and I remember.'”</p>
<p>So how do you develop that kind of outlook? How do you change your reactions to those outer
forces?</p>
<p>Make it a conscious priority. Think about it every day. “When you put your feet on the floor in
the morning,” explains Stanley R. Welty, Jr., president of the Wooster Brush Company, “you'll make
it a good day or a bad day by controlling your thought processes. We're either going to enjoy life
that day or we're not.</p>
<p>“And with all due respect to the external forces we all face in life and business every day, even
under the most frustrating situations, you get to decide in large measure what kind of day it will
be. So you laugh at the situation, if you have to. There are times you just throw up your hands, and
you laugh.”</p>
<p>Humor is vital. Never forget that this simple element helps maintain perspective. Welty agrees.
“Keep it in perspective,” he advises. “When things don't seem to be going well, relax, take your
time. Think about what's going on and your reaction to it. Tell yourself, Back up ten yards, and see
how we go at the next play.”</p>
<p>There are hundreds of things that can irritate, worry, or annoy you. Don't let them. Don't let the
small things get you down. “When you get cut off on the freeway, there are only two things you can
do,” says Ted Owen, publisher of the San Diego Business Journal, who like most Southern
Californians spends an awful lot of time behind the wheel. “You can swear at the other driver and
give some obscene gesture, or you can shrug and say to yourself, ‘How long is it going to take this
guy to end up in the junk heap? He's not going to make it to work the way he's driving.'”</p>
<p>Neither approach will have much effect on how quickly you arrive at the office. Shrugging at this
trivial irritation will get you there in a much happier and more productive frame of mind. It might
even add a couple of years to your life.</p>
<p>Owen wasn't born with this laissez-faire outlook on life. He used to have one of those hightension
personalities, but he came over the years to recognize how self-destructive it could be.
When he was asked to run the Business Journal, where he would be commenting frequently on
how other executives perform, he decided he'd better overcome his own attitude problems.
“Many of us tend to be reactive and over reactive,” he observes. “Since starting this job, I've
never been angry at work. I got angry other places, but I haven't been angry here.” People are
responding like they've never responded before.</p>
<p>After years of struggle, things were finally looking up for Mary Kay Ash. She had remarried. The
children were finally grown. She and her new husband had saved just enough money to start a
small cosmetics company, a dream she had nurtured for years.</p>
<p>Then her dream nearly disintegrated. “The day before we were to open this company,” Ash
recalls, “my husband died of a heart attack right there at the breakfast table. My husband was to
handle the administration of the company. I don't know a thing about administration, even today.
Every single penny was committed. We had only five thousand dollars, my personal savings. It
sounds like very little, but probably it would be worth fifty thousand today. “On the day of the
funeral, we had no time to waste. My two sons and my daughter and I sat down to decide what to
do. Do I stop or do I go on? All my dreams just plunged to the ground.”</p>
<p>But Mary Kay Ash believed in herself too much to give up. Her son Richard, who was just twenty,
offered to do what he could. “Mother,” he said, “I'll move to Dallas to help you.”</p>
<p>She had her doubts. “I thought, ‘Big deal/ How would you like to turn your life savings over to a
twenty-year-old? I figured maybe he could lift boxes I couldn't. I didn't know if he could fill out an
order or not. I mean, he had been just one kid that I had to bring up by myself.”</p>
<p>But Ash wasn't one to let doubt overwhelm her. She doesn't take well to defeat. So she pressed
on. “That was the beginning of the company. True to his word, Richard moved to Dallas the very
next day with his little two-month bride on his arm. The lawyers were saying, ‘Why don't you go
directly to the trash and throw the money in, because you're never going to make it.’ And
pamphlets from Washington told us how many cosmetics companies go broke every morning.”
Her positive attitude got her through it all. She just kept telling herself, “I think that people will
support that which they have to create. I think it can be done, and I'm going to try.” With an
attitude like that, is it any surprise that Ash succeeded?</p>

<p>These positive, self-confident feelings don't only help you achieve more. They also make other
people want to be associated with you. We all respond to the attitudes of others. That's why
people are drawn to those with upbeat outlooks on life. We want to surround ourselves with
friends or coworkers who are happy and productive, who have a can-do, it's-no-problem attitude.
Just as predictably, the constant complainer in any crowd doesn't get much company.
Why is this? Attitude rubs off on others, good or bad. This is a vital concept to remember for
anyone who wants to be a successful leader today. There are few more powerful motivators than a
positive attitude.</p>
<p>We all know organizations where a large percentage of the employees are unhappy. How did
they get that way? Slowly, one employee at a time. A leader has to fight that spread, constantly
substituting positive feelings and attitudes for negative ones.</p>
<p>David Luther, the quality chief at Corning, Incorporated, learned about the importance of
focusing on the positive —and ignoring the negative—from a smart union leader in Detroit, a man
who represented workers at a factory that made Lincolns and Thunder-birds.</p>
<p>“An enormous place, it had been very successful in quality,” Luther says. “This guy got up and
said, I made the change when I started worrying about the ninety percent who said yes instead of
the ten percent who said no.’ That's a very insightful statement because a lot of labor negotiations
revolve around the ten percent who are always resisting. People are always saying, ‘Well, let's
convert them.’ This guy knew better. He said, “That's the wrong way. I'm going to work with the
ninety percent who want to move forward.’ And that's what he did, a very insightful approach.”</p>
<p>Luther has developed this philosophy at Corning. “Eventually,” he says, “I may win some of the
others over, yes. But these ninety percent are ready to come along. They're sitting out there with
the power doors open. They're waiting, and the motor's running. You don't want to be locked in
here trying to convince these last people when the vast majority are waiting outside, ready to climb
on board.”</p>
<p>One of a leader's most important jobs, then, is to set a positive, self-confident tone, showing
others that failure isn't even a possibility.</p>
<p>When Julius Caesar sailed across the channel from Gaul and landed with his legions in what is
now England, what did he do to ensure the success of his army? A very clever thing: he halted his
soldiers on the chalk cliffs of Dover. Looking down to the waves two hundred feet below, the men
could see every one of the ships that had carried them across the channel— completely ablaze.</p>
<p>So here these soldiers were, stranded in the enemy's country, their last link with the Continent
entirely severed, their last means of retreat going up in smoke. What else could they do but
advance? What else could they do but conquer? What else could they do but fight with every
ounce of strength that was buried in their souls? That is precisely what they did.</p>
<p>A positive attitude isn't important only in life-or-death struggles like this, where the soldiers’
attitude was infused by desperation. It's also the secret to building a happy life and a successful
career. It is the cornerstone of leadership.</p>
<p>That's what Hugh Downs believes, at least. “You really don't have to be unkind,” says Downs, the
veteran ABC newsman and program host. Downs recalls a man he worked with in television—an
aggressive, hyper ambitious TV man on the make. “He was almost pathological. He sought to climb
by taking advantage of other people and what I call ‘kicking open doors.'”</p>
<p>The man did make some initial progress advancing his career, but the people he alienated, the
people he abused, the people he disrespected during his single-minded climb— they did not forget.
They resented him with a passionate unanimity. When he stumbled, as all of us will from time to
time, these people simply stepped aside and let him fall.</p>
<p>“I have never once kicked open a door of opportunity,” Downs says. So how then did he get so
far? Instead of aggressive ambition, he substituted patience and a keen attentiveness. “You need to
be alert,” he observes, “so that if the door ever opens, you can dart right through. If you kick a door
open, it's apt to come swinging back and hit you in the face. This has happened two or three times
to this man I was talking about. I've always believed you don't do it that way, but you have to be
alert to take advantage of whatever opportunity there is.” In the long run, his attitude has more
than paid off for Downs, and it's made the people he's worked with push for his success. “One of
the things I cherish most,” Downs says, “is something Tom Murphy gave to me.” Murphy was
chairman of Capital Cities ABC. “I don't remember what the occasion was. I guess it was my fiftieth
anniversary in broadcasting. He gave me a clock with an inscription that said—and it sounds
outrageously flattering—but it said, ‘Nice guys don't finish last.'</p>
<p>“I thought it was a very kind thing for the people here to say. The sentiment is true, and I feel
sorry for people who think they have to abandon a civilized approach to the world in order to be
successful. If that kind of technique brings any success, it's usually temporary. In the end, it's very
painful, and you build an awful lot of enemies on the way up.” And you won't enjoy the climb.</p>
