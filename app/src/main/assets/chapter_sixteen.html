<h2 align="center">THE POWER OF ENTHUSIASM</h2><br>


<p><i>The first class I ever conducted was held at the 125th Street YMCA in New York City. It was a small
class of fewer than ten men. One of the students, a salesman for the National Cash Register Company,
made an astounding speech. He said that he had been horn and brought up in the city. But the autumn
before, he had bought a country house. The house had just been built, and there was no grass and no
garden. He decided that he wanted a bluegrass lawn.</i></p>
<p><i>During the winter, he burned hickory wood in his fireplace and sprinkled the ashes on the ground
where he expected to make a lawn. “You know, I thought you had to sow seed to get bluegrass. But
you don't. All you have to do is to throw hickory-wood ashes on the ground in the autumn, and
bluegrass will come up in the spring.”</i></p>
<p><i>was astonished. I said to him, “If this is true, you have discovered what scientists have been working
for in vain for centuries. You have discovered how to take dead matter and make it produce living
matter. It just can't be done. Maybe bluegrass seed blew in on your land without you knowing
anything about it. Or there may have been bluegrass growing there already. But one thing is sure:
bluegrass won't grow from hickory-wood ashes alone.”</i></p>
<p><i>I was so sure of myself that I was calm and casual in my announcement. But the bluegrass man was
excited. He leaped to his feet and exclaimed; “I know what I'm talking about, Mr. Carnegie. After all, I
did it!”</i></p>
<p><i>And he went on and on and on, speaking with enthusiasm, animation, and spirit. When he finished, I
said to the class, “How many believe this man can do what he says he can do?”</i></p>
<p><i>To my amazement, everyone in the room shot up a hand. When I asked them why they believed,
practically all of them replied, “Because he seems so positive. He is so enthusiastic about himself.”</i><b>—DALE CARNEGIE</b></p>
<p>If enthusiasm can cause a group of intelligent business people to ignore the basic laws of science,
just imagine what it can do if someone is actually making sense.</p>
<p>Here is the bottom line on enthusiasm: it's infectious, and it makes people respond. This is true
in the classroom, in the boardroom, and on the campaign trail. It's just as true in the ice-hockey
rink. If you are not enthusiastic about an idea or a project, nobody else will ever be. If the leaders
don't believe enthusiastically in the direction of a company, don't ever expect the employees or the
customers or Wall Street to. The best way to get someone excited about an idea —or a project or a
campaign—is to be excited yourself. And to show it.</p>
<p>Tommy Draffen had just taken a new job as a salesman with Culver Electronics Sales, a California
importer of intercom speakers. According to the longstanding company practice, this meant one
thing: Draffen was handed a list of incredibly tough prospects. There was one firm in particular that
used to be a big Culver customer but had been lost years ago.</p>
<p>“I decided to make getting their business a personal challenge,” Draffen says. “That meant
convincing my company president that we could get the business back. He was not as sure as I was,
but he didn't want to throttle back my enthusiasm. So he allowed me to visit the customer.”</p>
<p>Draffen turned this account into a personal mission. He offered guaranteed pricing, reduced lead
time, and better service. He assured the company's director of purchasing that Culver would do
“whatever it takes to satisfy your needs.”</p>
<p>The key to Draffen's enthusiasm came during his first face-to-face meeting with the purchasing
director. He walked into the meeting with a smile on his face, and he said, “Glad to be back. We're
going to make this work together.”</p>
<p>Draffen never once thought he would not close this deal. He all but ignored the fact that his
company had already lost this account. With an upbeat, enthusiastic attitude, he convinced the
client that Culver was ready to serve again.</p>
<p>“As it turns out, the purchasing manager later told our president the only reason they were
entertaining our offers was because of my enthusiasm. They gave us the order that will turn out to
be half a million dollars a year.”</p>
<p>Before another word is written on the subject of enthusiasm, let's clarify a widespread
misconception once and for all. Loudness does not equal enthusiasm. Nor does pounding on the
table, or jumping up and down, or acting like a fool. That's fake. It's obvious. It doesn't fool anyone.
It almost always does more harm than good.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm is a feeling that has to come from inside. This concept is so important, it's worth
saying again. Enthusiasm is a feeling that has to come from inside. It's not to be confused with
boisterous hype.</p>
<p>It's true, increased physical movement and stronger voice projection sometimes accompany an
inner feeling of enthusiasm. But people who indulge in super animation—you know, “I'm great,
you're great, we're all so great today!” —Might as well wear a big I'm a Phony badge instead.</p>
<p>“Leadership starts out with the whole issue of integrity and credibility,” says Ray Stata, the
Analog Devices chairman. “So you have to be believed and believable. You have to be a person who
honors his or her word, a person whom people can trust. I think those are prerequisites for open
dialogue, as opposed to seeming manipulative or glad handing or insensitive or whatever.”</p>
<p>The real enthusiasts of history understood this intuitively. Back in the 1950s, was Jonas Salk
enthusiastic about creating a polio vaccine? Of course he was. He dedicated years of his life to the
pursuit. Anyone who came in contact with Salk could see his enthusiasm immediately in the way
his eyes lit up when he spoke about his research, in the round-the-clock sessions he led in the lab.
Salk became an inspiration for two generations of scientists. Yes, the man positively exuded
enthusiasm, but Salk did not rant and rave. Now he's devoting that very same enthusiasm to
finding a vaccine for the HIV virus, the one that causes AIDS.</p>
<p>In 1969 Neil Armstrong was just as enthusiastic about walking on the moon. The enthusiasm was
palpable even in his flat Ohio voice. “That's one small step for man,” he said, “one giant leap for
mankind.” Armstrong didn't need to shout the sentence or do a little jig before climbing back to the
Apollo spacecraft. But enthusiasm was obviously jampacked in Armstrong's thoughtful words.</p>
<p>In 1991, when General Norman Schwarzkopf led American troops in the Persian Gulf War, did he
seem nonchalant? Not by a long shot. He didn't have to scream and shout at his troops to make
them see he believed in their mission. You could just tell in a five-second news clip on CNN. None
of these great enthusiasts was especially loud or boisterous. But they left no one wondering how
they felt about their work.</p>
<p>True enthusiasm is made of two parts: eagerness and assurance. Be excited about something
and express confidence in your ability to handle it. That's all enthusiasm takes. Have those two
feelings about a company, a project, or an idea, and your enthusiasm will be dangerously
contagious. You'll have it. Others will know you have it. Pretty soon, they'll have it, too.
Guaranteed.</p>
<p>“Enthusiasm is something that always came naturally to me,” says Olympic gymnast Mary Lou
Retton. “I'm just a very positive person, and I've always surrounded myself with positive people.
That's important for me.”</p>
<p>That positive outlook was part of Retton's secret for getting through all the grueling training
sessions she had to endure as a young world-class gymnast. “There were times when my coach,
Bela Karolyi, was in a bad mood and was very strict in the gym. I would try to keep our group of
four or five girls positive. But if you had one girl who was down and said, ‘Gosh, I don't want to do
this,’ it would bring everybody down. I hated that. You could have ten people who were in the best
possible mood, but if you have that one negative person, you'd bring the whole group down. So I'd
try and steer away from those people.”</p>
<p>“Always surround yourself with happy, successful people,” agrees Harvey Mackay, the businessbook
author. “I don't go around with negative people. If your friends and your peers and the
people you respect and the people that you're reading about are upbeat, enthusiastic, confident
people with a lot of self-esteem, that will also become a part of you.”</p>
<p>It is almost impossible to underestimate the power of enthusiasm. “Every great and commanding
movement is the triumph of enthusiasm,” Ralph Waldo Emerson once said. “Nothing great was
ever achieved without it.” This was true of the civil rights movement. It was true of the founding of
America. It is just as true of all big companies today.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm is as important as high ability, as important as hard work. We all know people who
are brilliant and accomplish nothing. We all know people who work hard and get nowhere. But
people who work hard, love their jobs, and convey enthusiasm—those are the ones who are going
places.</p>
<p>Dale Carnegie once asked a friend how he chose his top subordinates, the people on whose
abilities his business would succeed or fail. The friend's answer might sound surprising to some.
“The difference in actual skill and ability and intelligence between those who succeed and those
who fail is usually neither wide nor striking,” said Frederick D. Williamson, president of the New
York Central Railway. “But if two people are nearly equally matched, the one who is enthusiastic
will find the scales tipped in his favor. And a person who has second-rate ability with enthusiasm
will often outstrip someone of first-rate ability without enthusiasm.”</p>
<p>The chief failing of IQ tests has always been that they don't measure a person's enthusiasm or
emotional drive. When these tests were first introduced two generations ago, they were touted as
amazing predictive tools. By measuring someone's “intelligence quotient,” you could predict with
great precision what that person would be able to achieve in life, or so the IQ testing companies
claimed.</p>
<p>If only life were as simple as that. The idea was alluring, especially at a time when the whole
world was placing more of its faith in science. The standardized-testing business took off. College
admissions officers relied on the tests slavishly to determine who was worth accepting. School
guidance counselors used them to steer youngsters into advanced or remedial work. The military
used the IQ tests to decide who was officer material and who got to clean latrines.</p>
<p>Sure, intelligence matters. Some people are blessed with more of it than other people, and that
makes certain things easier for them. Ditto for creative talent, or athletic prowess, or perfect pitch,
or any of life's other precious gifts. But this raw talent is really only half the total picture. The other
half we must paint for ourselves.</p>
<p>Sure, intelligence matters. Some people are blessed with more of it than other people, and that

or any of life's other precious gifts. But this raw talent is really only half the total picture. The other
half we must paint for ourselves.</p>
<p>Even the people at the Educational Testing Service, the New Jersey company that administers
many of today's standardized tests, now go to great lengths to emphasize how incomplete their
results really are. School admissions officers are warned not to interpret these results too rigidly. A
whole range of other factors must apply —personal enthusiasm at the top of the list.
National Hockey League Hall-of-Famer Denis Potvin, who led the New York Islanders to four
straight Stanley Cups, knows a little something about enthusiasm.</p>
<p>“When I got to training camp,” the former Islanders captain remembered, “I needed to be
emotionally excited about hockey. So I didn't take the approach that some players did, thinking I
should skate all summer long. I actually felt the opposite: I didn't want to skate a lot.</p>
<p>“So when I got into training camp, I was never in as great shape physically as a lot of the people
were. I knew I had to work extra hard to be in shape. But the thing I had over them was that I was
genuinely enthusiastic about playing hockey again. Here it was, the fifteenth September of my
professional career, and I felt like I was a kid again.”</p>
<p>No, you can't fake enthusiasm. But yes— absolutely, yes—you can create it, you can nourish it,
and you can put it to work for you. Dale Carnegie explained the process like this: “The way to
acquire enthusiasm is to believe in what you are doing and in yourself and to want to get
something definite accomplished. Enthusiasm will follow as night follows the day.”</p>
<p>How can you get this process started? “By telling yourself what you like about what you are
doing and passing on quickly from the part you don't like to the part you do like. Then act
enthusiastic. Tell someone about it. Let them know why it interests you. If you act ‘as if you are
interested in your job, that bit of acting will tend to make your interest real. It will also tend to
decrease your fatigue, your tensions, and your worries.”</p>
<p>Enthusiasm is easiest to attain when you have real goals in your life, things you are genuinely
looking forward to. Let that happen, and enthusiasm will grow inside of you. Wake up in the
morning and take a minute to think about something pleasing that will happen that day. It doesn't
have to be anything monumental. Maybe it's some part of your job you always enjoy. Maybe it's a
friend you're meeting for lunch. Maybe it's a family outing, a beer with your friends, an hour on the
squash court or in an aerobics class. Whatever the pleasing event is, what's important is this: life
doesn't need to be dull or uninteresting. We all need goals and experiences worth looking forward
to. These are the things that give a forward thrust to life. People who reflect on this even for a
moment can build a whole new way of looking at life. They can break from the ruts that they
restuck in. They will, in other words, live enthusiastically. When you do, the results can be truly
remarkable.</p>
<p>“Modern organizations need enthusiastic leadership more than ever,” believes Andres Navarro,
president of Chile's SONDA, S.A. “That's almost a definition of leadership —the ability to transmit
enthusiasm to other people for a common goal. If you want a group of people tomorrow or today
to have enthusiasm and feel happy working on a project, it's useless to write a memo, ‘Starting
tomorrow everyone will have a lot of enthusiasm.’” You have to have the enthusiasm yourself.
“If you don't have enthusiasm, it's impossible you will transmit enthusiasm to anyone,” Navarro
says. “So if you want to change an environment, first of all you have got to change yourself. If you
won't change first, you can't even change your children. If you want your son to be enthusiastic at
playing soccer, you've got to be enthusiastic.</p>
<p>“Enthusiasm is something you transmit through your eyes, in the way you move, the way you act
all day, more than the way you write it in a memo. Actually, I think all of us can have enthusiasm
for something. If you don't feel any type of enthusiasm, you might as well be dead. Once you
discover that you are enthusiastic in doing something, it's easy to develop the ability to get yourself
enthusiastically behind almost any goal.”</p>

<p>Indeed, having enthusiasm almost always assures success. That may be hard to believe, but the
raw evidence suggests it is true.</p>
<p>You can tell that David Webb, the former president of Lever Brothers Company, brims with
enthusiasm by just watching him walk through his office door. He's not a screamer or a grip-andgrin
artist. But there's a positive, •joyful spirit in his stride, head up, a look of eagerness in his eyes.
This may sound trivial, but this look has more force than most of us imagine. This is no accident.</p>
<p>“People are always going to read you in the elevator,” Webb says. “You express whatever your
values are twenty-four hours a day. People have a good memory.”</p>
<p>Webb goes on, “I learned this from a man who became the chairman of Unilever, Sir David Orr. I
took over for him in India. He was the marketing director. He knew everyone. David Orr went
everywhere. We have a huge network of distributors. Every time you go to a distributor, they
garland you. I toured all over India, and I tried desperately to find a distributor where David Orr
hadn't been, where there wasn't some photograph of him on the wall. He knew every salesman in
the country.” It was Sir David's enthusiasm they all remembered.</p>
<p>Webb learned this lesson, and he didn't forget it as he rose through the ranks to CEO of Lever
Brothers. “I'd met every salesman in this company —I think we've got about seven hundred fifty—
within three months of being in the business,” he recalls. “They know me. They can relate to me.
I'm out there playing the fool with them sometimes, enjoying the fun, just being with them. I love
the salesmen and the people in the plants. But there isn't anyone I don't like.”</p>
<p>Thomas Doherty was an executive at Nor star Bank when the regional financial institution was
acquired by Fleet Financial Group, Inc. Doherty stayed on, running all of Fleet's business for the
New York City region.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, many of Doherty's colleagues were extremely nervous about the change in
ownership. “That's natural,” Doherty says. “Customers, families, and friends are going to ask us,
‘How do you feel about the merger?’ If you're enthusiastic over it, then they are going to be
enthusiastic. I think attitude and enthusiasm are what people are looking for. If you come to your
desk every day and you have a long face, people read that immediately. But if you get on the
elevator and you say good morning to everyone just as you have in the past, people notice that.
They think, Gee, he's enthusiastic. Why not give it a chance?”</p>
<p>This prescription, of course, presupposes that there is something you like about your work.
Assessing this realistically may require a little soul-searching. The truth of the matter is that there
are things to like about most jobs, but let's not gloss over the hard reality: there are some jobs that
are simply miserable—or simply inappropriate to your temperament, your skills, or your goals. If
that condition applies to you, do something about it. You will never achieve real success if you
cannot be excited by your life or your work. Many people have bounced around from job to job
before finding the happy fit. There's nothing shameful about this. The shameful thing is to feel
miserable about a job— and not try to make it better or find another one.</p>
<p>If you're feeling bored with life, the people around you will be falling asleep as well. If you're
sarcastic and antagonistic, they will be too. If you're lukewarm, they will never boil.</p>
<p>So be enthusiastic. Watch the impact that has on the people around you, They’ll grow more
productive and eager to follow you. Passions, remember, are more powerful than cold ideas. And
genuine enthusiasm is contagious.</p>
