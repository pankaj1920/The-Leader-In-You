<h2 align="center">RECOGNITION, PRAISE, AND REWARDS</h2><br>
	<p><i>In the early nineteenth century, a young man in London aspired to be a writer. But everything seemed
to be against him. He had never been able to attend school more than four years. His father had been
thrown in jail because he couldn't pay his debts, and this young man often knew the pangs of hunger.
Finally he got a job pasting labels on bottles in a rat-infested warehouse, and he slept at night in a
dismal attic room with two other boys—guttersnipes from the slums of London. He had so little
confidence in his ability to write that he sneaked out and mailed his first manuscript in the dead of
night so nobody would laugh at him. Story after story was refused. Finally the great day came when
one was accepted. True, he wasn't paid for it, but one editor had praised him. One editor had given
him recognition. He was so thrilled that he wandered aimlessly around the streets with tears rolling
down his cheeks.</i></p>
<p>The praise, the recognition that he received through getting one story in print changed his whole life.
If it hadn't been for that encouragement, he might have spent his entire life working in rat-infested
factories. You may have heard of that boy. His name is Charles Dickens. <b>—DALE CARNEGIE</b></p>
<p>Mary Kay Ash, the cosmetics-company founder, began her life in the business world by giving sales
parties for the Stanley Home Products Company. She wasn't a very good saleswoman—not at first.
“We had to give the hostess a four-dollar-and-ninety-nine-cent mop and duster,” Ash recalls. “I was
making about seven dollars a party, so when I walked out the door, that left maybe two bucks.” But
Ash had three small children to support and not many marketable skills. So she kept on plugging.</p>
<p>After a few weeks she realized she wasn't going to make a living this way, not unless something
changed, fast. The time for drastic action had arrived. “I watched all these people telling me what
they sold, and I said, ‘How did they do it? Gee whiz, nobody bought those mops from me.’ I didn't
know how to do it. So I said, ‘I've got to go to the Stanley convention. I've got to find out how to do
it because I've got three kids to support.'”</p>
<p>For a single mother in Texas in those days, that was a real gamble. Ash had no money and no
encouragement. “I had to borrow the money that it took to go to the convention,” she said. “It cost
twelve dollars. That included the chartered train—now you're going to know how long ago this was
—from Houston to Dallas and back again, and it included three nights at the Adolph us Hotel. You
couldn't step across that threshold today for twelve dollars. I borrowed the twelve dollars from a
friend. I lost a lot of friends asking for the twelve bucks. I just tried to borrow it, and the one I got it
from said, ‘You ought to be staying home buying shoes for your kids with twelve dollars. You ought
not to be going on those wicked things that men go to.'”</p>
<p>But Ash wasn't swayed. “They didn't mention eating, and I liked to eat. So I thought, ‘Gee whiz, I
better pack some cheese and crackers.’ So I packed a pound of cheese and a box of crackers and
emptied out my Stanley samples suitcase. It was the only suitcase I had. I didn't have a real
suitcase. And I put my only other dress in it, along with the cheese and crackers. “I got on that
train, and people began to sing, S-T-A-N-L-E-Y, Stanley all the time. That's the slogan you will hear,
nothing buzzing in your ear.’ And I was like, ‘Oh, my gosh,’ I was so embarrassed. “Those crazy
people.’ I pretended not to be one of them. I didn't have any clothes, I didn't have anything. I must
have looked pretty awful, but I got there and that changed my life.”</p>
<p>Changed her life?“The Stanley people crowned a girl queen. Her name was Livita O'Brien. I'll never forget, she was
tall and skinny and black-haired and successful. My exact opposite. I watched from the last row in
the back of that room, and I decided next year I was going to be the queen. They gave her an
alligator bag. That was the biggest award. I wanted it with all my soul. I wanted that alligator bag.</p>

alligator bag. That was the biggest award. I wanted it with all my soul. I wanted that alligator bag.</p>
<p>“They didn't have a manual on how to sell, but they said three things. First, get a railroad track
to run on. Then, hitch your wagon to a star. Well, I had my work at Stanley, and I hitched my wagon
to that woman's star so hard she must have felt it from the back row. Finally they said, tell
somebody what you're going to do. Well, I looked around the room. I decided no use telling any of
them. I'd go up to the president, who was standing at the front. I went up to Mr. Frank Sammy
Beverage, and I said, ‘Mr. Beverage, next year I'm going to be the queen.’“Now, if he knew who he was talking to he would have laughed. I was three weeks in the
business, seven-dollar Stanley-party average, and I was going to be queen next year? Come on now,
really. But he was a very kind man. I don't know what he saw in me, but he took my hand, looked
me straight in the eye, and said, ‘You know, somehow I think you will.’ Those seven words changed
my life. I couldn't let him down. I mean I had pledged that I would be the queen next year.” And
she was.</p>

she was.</p>
<p>Mary Kay Ash went on to found a highly successful cosmetics company, using part-time Mary Kay
representatives to sell products to their friends, neighbors, and coworkers. She was motivated to
succeed before sheever joined Stanley. She had to be: she had no husband, no other job, and three
hungry children at home. Plus, she wanted the good feelings that come with being a success. The
encouragement she got from the president of the Stanley company gave her the incentive she
needed: a boost to her self-esteem, a feeling that someone else in the world cared if she
succeeded.</p>
<p>Sometimes motivating people can truly be that simple.</p>
<p>All people, from the president of the most successful corporation to the clerk at the supermarket
bottle return, want to be told that they're doing a first-rate job, that they're smart, they're capable,
and their efforts are recognized. A little bit of recognition —a dash of encouragement at just the
right moment—is often all it takes to transform a good employee into a great one.</p>
<p>“Why,” asked Dale Carnegie, “don't we use the same common sense when trying to change
people that we use when trying to change dogs? Why don't we use meat instead of a whip? Why
don't we use praise instead of condemnation? Let's praise even the slightest improvement. That
inspires the other fellow to keep on improving.”</p>
<p>It's not complicated at all. But for some reason many people find it hard to distribute even welldeserved
praise. “I used to find it difficult to give feedback, either positive or negative, and I don't
know why,” New York Life's Fred Sievert says. “It's so simple, and the value it brings is unbelievable.
I don't know why I ever resisted stopping and saying, ‘You know, I really appreciate you. Thank you
for what you've done. I know you've put in a lot of extra time, and believe me, I see it.'”</p>
<p>After years of holding back, Sievert said he finally learned the importance of giving praise, in part
from the man who was his boss. “He's a remarkable person, and he gives daily feedback,” Sievert
says. “He'll tell you when he's got a problem or something negative on his mind, but he'll also say, ‘I
appreciate you, and what you're doing is terrific’ It's so reassuring to hear that.” The comments
don't have to be earth-shatteringly large. “Occasionally,” Sievert goes on, “he recognizes I'm
working too hard, and he'll say ‘Get out of here. Go home. Spend time with your family. Take some
vacation days.’ Just the fact that he sees it is of great value to me.”</p>
<p>Rewards. When that word is used in the business world these days, it is almost always a
euphemism for money. Salary, bonuses, benefits, perks —those are the kinds of rewards most
people think about, the financial kind.</p>

<p>Now, there's no denying that money matters. In our society, it matters a great deal. But the full
truth of the matter is that money is only one of the reasons most people go to work in the morning
and only one of the things they bring home with them at night. Protest as we will, even the most
materialistic among us care intensely about other kinds of rewards.</p>
<p>Two items are at the very top of the reward list: self-respect and the respect of others. Those are
two of the most powerful motivating forces around. “People love to look good,” Harrison
Conference Services’ Walter Green is constantly reminding himself. “So part of what you want to do
is to create an environment for people to look good.”</p>
<p>That's what James Houghton has done at Corning. He tries to create an environment where
employees can look good and feel good. That's a recipe of a thousand ingredients, but one of them
involves Corning's procedure for dealing with employee suggestions.</p>
<p>Before becoming involved in the quality process, Corning used to solicit employees’ advice in a
half-hearted way. A few suggestion boxes were stuck off in the corners of Corning factories and
offices, where mostly they sat gathering dust. Recalls Houghton, “Our suggestion system was like
everybody else's in the sense that if you put it in there, and if it was accepted, you might get some
money for it. But what would happen is that you would put in the suggestion, and the suggestion
box was really just a black hole. You would hear nothing. Maybe six months later you would hear
something. And once you heard something, you would be mad. Either you would be told you
wouldn't get any money, or you'd get some money and you'd think it wasn't enough. Not only
would you be mad, but everybody else around you would be mad because you got the money and
they didn't.”</p>
<p>Today Corning handles employee suggestions far differently. “Now the boxes are gone,” along
with the whole approach they represent. “Not by mandate. Place by place, they just disappeared.”
That's not all that's changed. There's no money awarded in Coming's current employeesuggestion
program, but there is recognition. “What people get is Employee of the Week. They get
their picture up on the board, or they get flowers or a coffee mug, or somebody just says thank
you.” That acknowledgment is what makes the program work.</p>
<p>Don't employees miss the money? Not so you'd notice, Houghton says. “We set up only one rule.
If a suggestion is made, there has to be an answer within a couple of weeks* It depends, a week or
two weeks, whatever, but there has to be a quick answer. Yes or no or we're thinking about it.”</p>
<p>But now that money has been taken out of the equation, the number of suggestions has fallen,
right? “Last year,” Houghton reveals, “I think we got eighty times as many suggestions as we ever
got. We implemented around forty or fifty times as many.”</p>
<p>People participate for several reasons. They want to improve the quality of their work lives—
that's obviously part of it—and they make suggestions because they know that someone will listen
when they do. But just as certainly, they participate because they want the self-respect and the
public acknowledgment that come with submitting a good idea. Houghton says he wasn't the
slightest bit surprised. “What it says to me is that people care, and they want to be involved. All
you have to do is release them and say thank you. It's amazing what happens.”</p>
<p>Houghton's right. Employees who feel that their contributions are being recognized and
respected do accomplish amazing things. Making employees feel appreciated, focusing attention on
their good ideas, inviting them to attend trade shows that used to be limited just to the top brass,
saying, “Thank you. We know you're a good employee. We value you and your work"—that is the
beginning of effective motivation.</p>
<p>Well-led companies today are spending time, energy, and money bringing these nonmonetary
rewards to life.</p>
<p>“What I'm doing now,” said Anders Bjorsell, president of Elektrotryck AB, Sweden's largest
producer of printed computer cards, “is giving recognition in front of the whole group. That's very
important—to tell someone in front of as many people as possible, ‘Hey, you did a very good job.’
It's not nearly as good to say that privately.”</p>
<p>The pleasure comes from receiving recognition publicly. “That's what makes people feel
appreciated,” Bjorsell believes. “You should never stop doing this, and you can never do it enough.”
Val Christiansen owns the highest-volume Denny's restaurant in America. That's number one out
of eighteen hundred nationwide.</p>
<p>Christiansen's restaurant, which is located in Victorville, California, in the high desert between
Los Angeles and Las Vegas, serves lots of salads, soups, sandwiches, and main courses. But
Christiansen had noticed one area of weakness. Too many of the customers finished with their
meals and then called out for the check. What the restaurant needed, Christiansen decided, was to
sell more pies. So he announced a contest to see who could sell the most.</p>
<p>“When we started,” he recalls, “we were selling two pies a day. So I explained to the crew how I
thought they should sell pies. I gave them a little demo on how to sell pies. That crew knows me
well enough now to say, ‘Okay, Mr. C, if we start selling all these pies, what's in it for us?’ I mean
they are a bunch of ruthless capitalists, and we understand that, and that's okay.”</p>
<p>The top seller on each shift, Christiansen told the employees, would be treated to a big night on
the town. “That person and their spouse or whoever will be driven into Los Angeles in a
chauffeured limousine to see Phantom of the Opera.”</p>
<p>The day-shift winner, a woman who had never seen a play before, brought her husband along
for the big night. “They spent the night in this huge stretch limo. They had a wonderful time. That
was Friday night. Sunday morning, I come in. She catches me at the cash register. She's in uniform,
working. She puts her arms around me. She doesn't hug me. She holds me, and holds and holds.”</p>
<p>“Some opera, huh?” Christiansen asked her.</p>
<p>He recalls the scene. “We're busy. We're jumping. The place is packed with people. And she's just
holding me. She releases me, and the tears are just coming down her face. She says to me, ‘Mr. C, I
love you. Thank you.’ She says to me that she's giving me notice. She'll quit in thirty years.”</p>
<p>All because of that one act of recognition.</p>
<p>“It built her self-esteem,” Christiansen says. “Our pies went from two a day to seventy-one pies
sold a day. So I got rewarded economically, and I got rewarded emotionally. I can't throw money at
an employee and expect to get those kinds of results.”</p>
<p>There is no shortage of reward programs out there to copy —almost as many as there are wellled
companies today. Some of these programs are quite imaginative. The possibilities are limited
only by the creativity of the people running them. So give the people at SGS-Thomson credit. They
are one creative group.</p>
<p>They started an unusual award program called the Human Resource Quality Award, where
employees are recognized for excellence, not in manufacturing or research and development or
production, but in human relations. Bill Makahilahila, Director of Human Resources, describes the
program he created. “We have four awards that we give out every quarter to managers who
demonstrate certain behaviors. One is called the Golden Ear Award, and we actually have an award
with a golden ear stuck on a plaque. It's for demonstrating good listening skills. Employees can
nominate a manager or another employee or whoever it may be who demonstrates these skills.
Then we have the Silver Tongue Award. The Silver Tongue Award has to do with effective
communication, and not just in formal presentations. We have this unique plaque that the winner
gets, and it's got a silver tongue coming out. We thought we'd make the system a little humorous
using various body parts.”</p>
<p>No, there is no Big Feet Up on the Desk Award.</p>
<p>“We have the Empowerment Award,” Makahilahila continues. “That's for demonstrating to
employees how we empower one another. And we have the fourth award, which is the major
award. It's called the People Leadership Award. This is for the person who demonstrates all of the
best characteristics —honesty, integrity, sincerity —on a regular basis. This person should also
demonstrate effective communication, listening skills, interpersonal skills, people skills, and so
forth. Now, this particular award plaque shows a leader holding his or her people up on a platform.
So the whole concept here is actually supporting and holding up people as opposed to looking
down on them.”</p>
<p>Then there's Mary Kay Cosmetics Inc. That company has no equal in the contest for the most
striking reward. At Mary Kay the top earners of the year receive a pink—yes, a pink—Cadillac.
“About three years after we started, we were doing fairly well,” Mary Kay Ash explains. “We had
gotten to a million dollars, as a matter of fact. I needed a new car, so I went down to the Cadillac
dealer, and I took my little compact out of my purse. I said to the man, ‘I want a new Cadillac, and I
want it painted this color.'”</p>
<p>The salesman got a pale look on his face. “He looked at it, and he said, ‘Oh, Mary Kay, you don't
really. Really, you don't. Let me tell you what it's going to cost you to get that thing repainted when
it gets here and you don't like it.’ I said, ‘Please, I want it pink.’ He said, ‘Okay, but don't forget I
warned you. Don't blame me for this disaster.'</p>
<p>“It came, and even on the way home it created a sensation with people driving by. It was
amazing. It really was. You know how you can sit in a black Lincoln at a stop sign two hours and
nobody will let you through? Drive a pink Cadillac. It's amazing the respect and admiration that
thing gets.”</p>
<p>Memorable? Yes. Understated? No. But then no one ever accused Mary Kay Ash of being
understated.</p>
<p>“So the people loved it. They saw it as a big pink trophy on wheels, and they wanted to know,
What do we have to do to get one?” She said. “My son Richard is the financial wizard of the
company, and I took the question to him. I said, ‘Richard, put a pencil to this, and tell me what
someone would have to do to be able to win a pink Cadillac’ He said, ‘Oh, Mother, really,’ but he
figured it out. He told us how much. And you know the higher you put the thing, the higher they'll
jump. So the first year we gave one. Second year, five.</p>
<p>Third year, ten. Fourth year, twenty. After that, we opened it up to anybody who does a certain
number of dollars, and that's the way it remains today.</p>
<p>“So today we have sixty-five million dollars’ worth of cars running around the nation, and even if
you don't know anything else about Mary Kay Cosmetics, if you see a pink car in Salem,
Massachusetts, it's Mary Kay. People know that. It's become a symbol.” A useful symbol for the
company and a useful symbol for the employees as well. It says, “You're superior. You've done a
topflight job. Keep it up.”</p>
<p>The United States Government isn't passing out pink Cadillacs. Not yet, at least. But even the
government has gotten into the act when it comes to creative recognition. It's set up the Federal
Quality Institute.</p>
<p>The Institute was founded in 1988 by an order of President Reagan. Its original mission was to try
to find ways for increasing productivity in government. The think tank that was hired to do the
initial research and planning on the idea reached the same conclusion that businesses like Corning
and Motorola had: if you want to increase productivity, focus positive attention on quality and
keep it there. Productivity will follow. “People are the most important part of the equation,” says
G. Curt Jones, the institute's senior quality executive.</p>
<p>As an integral part of Washington's quality-improvement plans, the institute began its own
program of employee recognition, the President's Award. This is the public-sector version of the
Baldrige Award, and believe it or not, the competition is just as stiff. One year's award went to the
IRS service center in Ogden, Utah, whose employees figured out how to process tax returns more
quickly, even in the face of i severe budget cuts.</p>
<p>Awards like this are just one idea. American Airlines has found an exquisitely targeted method
for rewarding its employees. The airline's customers are brought directly into the process. Since
flight attendants do most of their work in the air, literally thousands of miles away from
supervisors, it's difficult for the airline to know exactly who is and who isn't doing a stand-out job.
Given the constraints of a union contract, the airline is limited in its ability to pay certain flight
attendants more than others.</p>
<p>But American Chairman Robert L. Crandall came up with a creative way around these problems.
Gold-and platinum-level members of American's frequent-flyer club receive special certificates that
can be turned over to a flight attendant in recognition of exemplary service. The flight attendants
can cash in the certificates for free trips and other benefits. It's a creative method that works for
the customer, who gets the pleasure of expressing thanks in a concrete way, and it works for the
flight attendants too.</p>
<p>This idea of using rewards and recognition as an integral part of doing business isn't a new one.
It's as old as the personal thank-you note.</p>
<p>John Robinson of Fleet Financial Group, Inc., learned that from an old friend several decades
ago. “Jim Bender was a very successful salesman early in his career, and he told me what he used to
do was he'd go on the road and make calls all day long. Then he'd go to his motel room at night
and set out a bottle of bourbon and have a stack ofpaper. He'd always write a personal note.</p>
<p>“Throughout his life he's written, handwritten, all these personal notes,” Robinson says. “And in
this age of very sophisticated marketing and direct-mail marketing and that sort of thing, nothing
has quite the impact of a hand-scribbled note saying, ‘Gee, you did a great job handling that
situation,’ or ‘I really admire how you handled so and so.</p>
<p>Do people care about these small acknowledgments? Joyce Harvey of Harmon Associates
Corporation sure thinks so. “We have little notes that are printed to say, ‘Thank you. We
appreciate what you did today.’ I find that as I go around the office, they're tacked up over people's
desks. I used to find that people were helping each other and never getting recognition for it from
their colleagues. Now they get a simple ’Thank you’ or ‘I appreciate what you did’ or ‘You made my
life a little easier.’ It's working very well.”</p>

<p>Reward, recognition, praise. It doesn't matter how you do it; what matters is that you do it,
again and again and again. The bottom line on rewarding employees is this. Sure, money's
wonderful. But it's not the only effective reward. If you have money to spend, use it intelligently.
Reward excellence. Encourage employee participation. Spend it in ways people appreciate.</p>
<p>And whether your budget is small or large, follow the advice of writer and lecturer Florence
Littauer. Littauer was asked unexpectedly one day to give the children's sermon at her church. One
passage from the Bible came to mind, but it was a difficult one for children to grasp: “Let no
corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good. Good to the use of
edifying that it may minister grace unto the hearers.”</p>
<p>Littauer worked with the children, deciphering the difficult words, and finally came up with an
interpretation that she felt captured the meaning of the passage: “Our words really should be like a
present,” she said, and the children seemed to agree. “A little gift. Something that we give to other
people. Something that they want. Something that they reach out for. They grab our words, and
they take them in, and they love them. Because our words made them feel so good.”</p>
<p>Littauer went on like that a bit, comparing words to gifts. Then she summed up her message.
“Now,” she said, “let's start from the beginning. My words should not be bad. They should be good.
They should be used to build up, not knock down. They should be words that would come out like
a present.”</p>
<p>When she finished, a little girl jumped up, walked out into the aisle, turned around to the entire
congregation, and said in a loud and clear voice, “What she means is,” and then the girl stopped to
catch her breath. “What she means is that our words should be like a little silver box with a bow on
top.”</p>
<p>Praise is not only welcomed by children. It goes a long way in the business world as well.</p>
