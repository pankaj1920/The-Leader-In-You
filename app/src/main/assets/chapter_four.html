<h2 align="center">EXPRESSING GENUINE INTEREST IN OTHERS</h2><br>


	<p><i>Why read this book? Why not study the technique of the greatest winner of friends the world has ever
known? Who is he? You may meet him tomorrow coming down the street. When you get within ten
feet of him, he will begin to wag his tail. If you stop and pat him, he will almost jump out of his skin to
show you how much he likes you. And you know that behind this show of affection on his part, there
are no ulterior motives. He doesn't want to sell you any real estate, and he doesn't want to marry
you.</i></p>
<p><i>Did you ever stop to think that a dog is the only animal that doesn’t have to work for a living? A hen
has to lay eggs. A cow has to give milk, and a canary has to sing. But a dog makes his living by giving
out nothing but love.</i></p>
<p><i>You can make more friends in two months by becoming genuinely interested in other people than you
can in two years by trying to get others interested in you. Let me repeat that. You can make more
friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to
get other people interested in you.</i></p>
<p><i>Yet I know and you know people who blunder through life trying to badger other people into becoming
interested in them. Of course, it doesn't work. People are not interested in you. They are not
interested in me. They are interested in themselves— morning, noon, and after dinner.</i><b>—DALE CARNEGIE</b></p>
<p>Lynn Povich, editor-in-chief of Working Woman magazine, spent twenty-five years of her life at
Newsweek. She started as a secretary, moved up to researcher, and eventually became the first
woman ever named a Newsweek senior editor. This put her in the position of supervising writers
and editors she had once worked for as a researcher. “It was an interesting turn of events,” Povich
says.</p>
<p>Most of her colleagues reacted quite well to the promotion, all except one of the six section
editors who now reported to her. Povich recalls, “He was against the idea from the very beginning
—not because he disliked me, but because he felt that I had gotten the job only because I am a
woman and that I probably didn't have the credentials for it. He didn't say anything to me, but I
heard from several other people that that's what he thought.”</p>
<p>Povich tried not to let this bother her. She immersed herself in the new job. She helped develop
story ideas. She spent time talking to the writers. She expressed a sincere interest in each of the
sections she was responsible for— medicine, media, television, religion, lifestyle, and ideas.</p>
<p>Then one day, about six months after Povich’s appointment, her big critic walked into her office
and sat in a chair across from her desk. “I have to tell you something,” he said to her. “I was totally
against this move. I thought you were too young. I thought you didn't have the experience. I
thought you got the promotion only because you were a woman.</p>
<p>“But I want to say I really appreciate the interest you've shown in the work, in the writers, and in
the section editors. I've had four guys who were senior editors before you. It was clear to me they
were all using this as a stepping-stofle for the next position. None of them genuinely cared, It's
absolutely clear that you really are interested, and you show that interest to everyone. "Not
surprisingly, Povich has brought that same management style—developed over the years—into her
new job at Working Woman. “You have to take people seriously,” she explains. “First of all, you
can't be remote. You have to touch base with them on a regular basis. I do a lot of walking around
and talking to people. We have a system of regular meetings so that everyone here knows there's a
particular time, a particular week, when they're actually going to be alone with me. They'll have
their time to say whatever they want to. I'm available. I'm interested in what they're doing, I'm
interested in their work, and I'm interested in them as people.”</p>
<p>Expressing genuine interest in others—there's no better way to make people interested in you.
People respond to people who are sincerely interested in them. They can't help but respond.
This is one of the most basic facts of human psychology. We are flattered by other people's
attention. It makes us feel special. It makes us feel important. We want to be around people who
show interest in us. We want to keep them close. We tend to reciprocate their interest by showing
interest in them.</p>
<p>Monsignor Tom Hartman has become something of a legend among young Roman Catholics on
Long Island, New York. He has, over the years, been asked to perform more than thirty-eight
hundred weddings and to baptize more than ten thousand newborn babies. Why do all these
people keep turning to the Monsignor? Aren't there any other priests out there to choose from? Of
course there are, but few manage to show the intense interest in other people that Hartman is so
well know for.</p>
<p>Hartman doesn't preside over assembly-line wedding ceremonies. He takes a more studied,
individual, personal approach. He wants to know everything he possibly can about the two people
who have come to him to be married. He invites them to the rectory. He visits their homes. Over a
period of several months, he leads them through a series of conversations about themselves. That
way, he can tailor a wedding that will fit their personal interests and needs.</p>
<p>“Yes, I'll do your wedding,” he tells these couples, “but I don't want it to be just a ritual. I want to
discover the mystery here. I want this to be the best wedding possible for you. I want to know
about you. I want to talk with you about what you've discovered about your relationship, what you
love about each other. I want to learn about the struggles you've had and how you got through
those struggles. And I'm going to communicate that at your wedding.”</p>
<p>A Hartman wedding isn't the quickest and easiest trip to the altar. But Hartman's personal
interest pays major dividends for these couples. Through his caring, they learn new things about
each other. “When people see that I am so interested in an important moment in their lives, they
began to listen to me on other levels too,” he said. <br>
Hartman takes the same personal approach when asked to perform a baptism. He wants to know
about the family, about the child, about all the things that make this birth so special to those
involved. He has gone so far as to attend Lamaze classes with one single mother whose baby he
was going to baptize.</p>
<p>That one expression of interest, he says, has given him an added degree of credibility when he
encourages prospective fathers to go through this preparation as well. By attending classes himself,
Hartman says, “I was able to get on the trust level with so many men and say, ‘Do it. It will
introduce you to mystery.’ Many men have come back to me later, thrilled they'd done it, and said,
‘If I never had that experience, I would be on the outside looking in.'”</p>
<p>There are many different ways of showing interest, and most of them are much easier than
attending Lamaze classes. An expression of interest can be as simple as using a pleasant voice on
the telephone. When someone calls, say hello in a tone that implies, “I'm happy to hear from you.”
When you see a familiar face at the shopping mall, greet the person and express a genuine
pleasure at the coincidence.</p>
<p>Smile at people. Learn their names and how to pronounce them. Get the spellings and the titles
right. Remember their birthdays. Ask about their husbands and wives and children. “I always knew
that Clarence Michalis was at Bristol-Myers,” says David S. Taylor, secretary-treasurer of H. G.
Wellington & Company, Inc., an investment-brokerage firm. “The minute we met, that would click. I
remember those two things together. Not everybody does. I have a memory bank that would
connect people with businesses.”</p>

<p>You never know when these names will come in handy. Taylor learned this lesson when he was
working as an executive in the beverage industry. “When I worked for Canada Dry,” he said, “it may
be hard to think why, but it was important for\ me to know people in the airline industry. They
were a big customer. Grumman Aircraft fed a lot of people, and they had a lot of vending machines
that dispensed drinks.</p>
<p>“It was just an entree. You could call up and say, ‘Look, I'm having a problem with such-andsuch.’
Remembering these names and having those connections was enormously helpful.”
Taylor used this technique as the basis for forming genuine relationships with people. By taking
the time to remember people's names and associations, he has been able to help bring people
together and solve their problems.</p>
<p>Don't limit those expressions of interest to the so-called important people in your life. Chances
are they already get plenty of attention. Don't forget the secretaries, the assistants, the
receptionists, the messengers, and all the other under recognized people who keep your life on
track. Ask about their days. It's the right thing to do—and you'll be surprised how much quicker the
mail arrives at your desk in the morning.</p>
<p>Interest in people has always been a personal trademark of Adriana Bitter, president of
Scalamandre Silks. One day Bitter was walking through the wallpaper-print area. She overheard the
head of Scalamandre's wallpaper department talking to an employee. “How are you, Louie?” the
department head asked.</p>
<p>“Oh, not too well,” Louie answered. “I've been suffering from a depression.”</p>
<p>“Do you know why?” Bitter asked him, walking up.</p>
<p>“Do you know why?” Bitter asked him, walking up.</p>
<p>Bitter asked a few more questions. “I think it's a good idea if you see a doctor about this,” she
said finally.</p>
<p>“I went to see a doctor, and I had to go up to the thirty-second floor, and I was so afraid.”</p>
<p>“Maybe you'd better find a doctor on the first floor,” Bitter told him.</p>
<p>“You know, I had a dream the other night, Mrs-Bitter,” he said. “I dreamed that I was so
frightened, and you came up and put your arms around me and told me not to worry.”</p>
<p>So Bitter put her arms around him and said, “Don't worry, Louie. It will go away. Take some deep
breaths.”</p>
<p>They talked some more. He started to laugh, and he said, “Will you come on the plane with me?”
Bitter laughed with him.</p>
<p>“He left yesterday,” she said a few days later. “So I guess he's doing fine.”</p>
<p>People will respond immediately to a genuine expression of warmth. So be sincere. Honest,
heartfelt interest has to be built up over time.</p>
<p>A great way to open a conversation—even a business conversation—is to notice an item that
relates somehow to the person you're speaking with. It could be a drawing on the office wall, a,
desktop pencil holder made by a child, a squash racquet leaning in the corner of the room. Make a
comment that shows interest, admiration, or warmth. Or ask a question of a similar kind. “That's a
beautiful picture. Who's the artist?” Or “What a thoughtful gift. Is that from one of your children?”
Or “Squash? Isn't that a hard game to learn?” There's nothing profound about any of those
remarks. But every one of them shows a basic, personal interest in the other person, and it
connects in a positive, tasteful way.</p>
<p>Such displays of interest are the fundamental building blocks of successful human relationships.
They are the little details that say, “You are important to me. I'm interested. I care.” Very few
people in this world mind hearing that.</p>
<p>Everything was going well for Steven and Robin Weiser. Steven ran a successful insurance agency.
They had a lovely suburban home. He was a consistently generous philanthropist. The couple's
oldest daughter was in her first year at Yale, and the younger twins were doing great in high school.
Then one Saturday night as Steven and Robin were eating at a restaurant, he had a massive
heart attack and died. He was just forty-five years old.</p>
<p>The funeral was packed with hundreds of people Steve Weiser had touched—his friends, his
business associates, officials from the many charities he supported. Many of these people made
condolence calls at the Weiser home.</p>
<p>What was nearly as shocking as Steven's untimely death was something his wife said that night.
“It's a shame that Steven didn't know how many people he touched, how many people loved him,”
Robin Weiser said.</p>
<p>Steven Weiser? With all those friends and associates? After all that charity work? Apparently few
of these people had ever told him how they felt.</p>
<p>Don't make the same mistake. When you care about someone —a friend, a spouse, a colleague—
by all means let that person know. And do it while you have the chance.</p>
<p>Even more important than expressing interest is showing it. Harrison Conference Services, Inc., is
in the business of organizing meetings and seminars, worrying about all the logistics so the clients
can keep their minds focused on the real work at hand. To thrive, a company like Harrison must
show its guests, over and over again, that the staff is genuinely— almost single-mindedly—
interested in them.</p>
<p>It's not enough to have beautiful conference facilities, as Harrison certainly does. It's not enough
to have attractive rooms, first-rate cuisine, high-tech audiovisual equipment, or a plethora of
recreational choices, all of which Harrison has. Unless the guests feel they're being treated with
genuine interest and respect, they'll take their business elsewhere.</p>
<p>“I remember a guest who was attending one of our international programs, a man from China,”
says Walter A. Green, Harrison's chairman. “One of our people, a hostess, overheard him saying he
missed the food of his native country. Well, the hostess happened to be a Chinese chef on the side.
The next day she went home and prepared some special Chinese food,” and brought the dishes
into work. “I can't tell you how taken he seemed by this personal concern for his comfort and by
the thrill of being able to share his own cuisine with the people at his table.”</p>
<p>What the hostess's action said was, “We are interested—genuinely interested, consistently
interested—in you.” Who wouldn't appreciate that kind of attention?</p>
<p>Thankfully, this way of relating is a habit easily learned and very gratifying. All it takes is the
realization of how important it is and a little bit of practice. Try it with the next person you meet:
“Whatever happened to that summer house you were thinking of buying?” Or “What a great view
you have in here. How do you stop yourself from staring out the window all day?”</p>
<p>Once you start this process, it will quickly become a natural part of your life. Before you know it,
you'll be expressing interest, showing interest, and really becoming more interested in the people
around you. The added benefit is that a genuine interest in others will take you outside yourself
and make you less focused on whatever your own problems are.The more you stay focused on
other people, the more rewarding your personal relationships will be and the fewer negative
thoughts you will have. Not a bad payback for a few kind words.</p>
<p>Best-selling business author Harvey B. Mackay started out his career in the envelope industry.
That's where he learned many of the lessons that make up his best-selling books. “I'm very strong
on creative gifts,” Mackay says, “and when I say a gift, I'm not talking about something that's
expensive and costs money.”</p>
<p>Mackay had an envelope salesman, “a man who in my judgment was just a C-plus salesman,” he
recalls. “I remember him telling me that one of his buyers had a baby girl, so he went down and
bought a gift. Fine, that's wonderful. But the gift was not for the baby girl. It was for the jealous
brother at home. He was a year and half, just a piddly little thing. But I remember, that one
creative gesture stuck with me right away. All of a sudden I didn't think of him as a C-plus anymore.
Now he's our key sales manager.”</p>
<p>Expressing this kind of interest in others is especially important when you're the new kid on the
block. It was as if Bill Clinton already knew that when he showed up for his first day of
kindergarten. He was, his teacher has said, naturally friendly and disarming-ly interested in the
other children.</p>
<p>“Hi,” he went around saying. “I'm Bill. What's your name?” Corny? Maybe. But then none of his
classmates in Hope, Arkansas, expressed any surprise when little Billy was elected president of the
United States.</p>
<p>An open, friendly, interested greeting is just as important when you're the new person in the
office or the new business-owner in town. The message should not be, I'm here, now what can you
do for me? It should be instead, I'm here, now what can I do for you?</p>
<p>So volunteer at the local hospital. Sign up as a Little League coach. Join the PTA. Get involved in a
local charity. These are all ways of showing interest in the community, of saying, “I care about this
place.” Any one of these will help you meet new people in a comfortable environment. It will be
fun. It will make you feel good about yourself. It will help you develop new relationships, gain selfconfidence,
and it will bring you out of your comfort zone.</p>
<p>Dale Carnegie understood this. “If you want others to like you,” he wrote, “if you want to
develop real friendships, if you want to help others at the same time as you help yourself, keep this
principle in mind: Become genuinely interested in other people.”On this score there is no doubt that Carnegie practiced what he preached, even at home with his
family. J. Oliver Crom, who is now president of Dale Carnegie & Associates, Inc., discovered this the
first time he met his future in-laws.</p>

<p>“To say I was nervous about meeting Dale Carnegie would be an understatement,” Crom
remembers. “Well, within seconds of meeting him, he had me relaxed, talking about myself, and
the way he did that was by asking me questions.” Carnegie merely expressed interest in the,
gentleman young Rosemary had brought home.</p>
<p>“First of all I said, ‘Well, Mr. Carnegie, it's very nice to meet you.’ And he said, ‘Oh, please, call
me Dale. Mr. Carnegie sounds so formal.’ And then he said, ‘I understand you were born in
Alliance, Nebraska.’ I said, ‘Yes, that's right’ And he said, “Tell me, do the same wonderful people
live in Alliance that lived there so many years ago when I sold in that territory?’ And I said, ‘Yes,
they do.’ He said, ‘Well, tell me about some of the people out there, and tell me about yourself.’ So
he got me talking about myself and about Alliance.”</p>
<p>Things progressed swiftly from there. “We took walks in the parks together. We went down and
worked in his rose garden. We went to the theater together. He and I rode the subway into the city.
We went to see The Seven Year Itch, which was on Broadway at the time. I don't remember much
about the play, but I remember, when we went for a walk in Forest Hills Gardens, he knew
everyone in the little park. He knew the policeman. He knew all the people walking their dogs and
called them by name. They all stopped and greeted him. I didn't know at the time thatthis was so
unusual. Coming from the Midwest, I thought that's the way people are.”</p>
<p>Stephen Ghysels, who is now a vice president at the Bank of America, learned the hard way how
important it is to take a genuine interest in others.</p>

<p>Ghysels got an impressively early start on the fast track. Back in the late 1980s, fresh out of
college, he was already an officer at a large investment firm. He had an Art Deco condo on the west
side of Los Angeles and a Mercedes in the driveway—all by age 25. “I thought I had it all and I let
people know. I had a real attitude.</p>
<p>“But just as the recession was approaching in 1990,” Ghysels says, “my boss called me into the
office and said, ‘Steve, it's not your performance. It's your attitude. People in this office just don't
like working with you. I'm afraid we are going to have to part company.'</p>
<p>“It hit me like a rock. I, Mr. Success, was being fired. I knew it wouldn't take me very long to find
another high-paying executive position. Wrong. Welcome to the recession, Steve!</p>
<p>“After several frustrating months of job searching, the attitude layer peeled off and revealed a
thick layer of fear. For the first time in my life I lacked confidence and was gripped by an intense
fear. Since I had previously alienated everyone, I had nowhere to turn, no one to talk to. I was
alone.”</p>
<p>Only then did Ghysels learn to be interested in others. He started listening. He started caring
about something other than himself. He gained a perspective on his own trouble, meeting people
who were far worse off than himself. He opened himself up and became more human, more likable,
and infinitely more employable.</p>
<p>“I began to look at other people in a different light,” he recalls. “My attitude changed. I felt
differently. My fear was reduced. My mind was opened. And people began to take notice. The
quality of my life was better, even though I had to sell the condo and the Mercedes. “Three years
later, I once again have an officer-level job—only this time I'm surrounded by coworkers I can
honestly call my friends.”</p>
