<h2 align="center">STARTING TO COMMUNICATE</h2><br>

<p><i>Theodore Roosevelt's children adored him, and they had good reason to. An old friend came to
Roosevelt one day in distress. His young son had left home and gone to live with his aunt. The boy was
wild. He was this and he was that. And the father claimed that no one could get along with him. <br>
Roosevelt said, “Nonsense. I don't believe there's a thing wrong with the boy. But if a boy with spirit
can't get the right sort of treatment at home, he'll go some place else to get it.”</i></p>
<p><i>Several days later Roosevelt saw the boy and said, “What's all this I hear about your leaving home?”
“Well, Colonel,” said the boy, “every time 1 go to Dad he explodes. He's never given me a chance to
tell my story. I'm always wrong. I'm always to blame.”</i></p>
<p>“You know, son,” said Roosevelt, “you may not believe it now, but your father is your best friend. You
are more to him than all the rest of the world.”</p>
<p>“That may be, Colonel Roosevelt,” the boy said, “but I do wish he'd take some other way of showing
it.”</p>
<p>Then Roosevelt sent for the father, and he began to tell the father a few shocking truths. The fattier
exploded just the way the boy described. “See here, “said Roosevelt. “If you talk to your boy the way
you've just been talking to me, I don't wonder he left home. I only marvel that he didn't do it before.
Now you go and get acquainted with him. Meet him halfway.”</p>
<p>Nothing could be easier than failing to communicate. Condescending, contradicting, berating,
demeaning, treating other people as if “I am the boss, and you just work here"—until recently
these were widely accepted forms of human interaction inside some of the largest and best-known
companies in the world. “Barking rights” were thought to be a natural prerogative of executive
positions, along with an office window and a two-hour lunch. Families, schools, and other
organizations unfortunately followed suit.</p>
<p>For years loudness was equated with toughness. Stubbornness was equated with superior
knowledge. Argumentativeness was equated with honesty. We should all—supervisor and
employee, parent and child, teacher and student—be grateful those days are finally coming to an
end.</p>
<p>Jerry Greenwald, former vice chairman of Chrysler Corporation, compares the old corporate
method of communication to a trickle-down version of that childhood game, telephone. “If two
teenagers live next to each other and they have something to sort out between them, one crosses
the lawn, and they talk it out. If they were two people in two departments of a corporation, the
teenager would tell his older brother, who would tell his mother, who would tell his father, who
would go next door and tell the father of the other teenager, who would tell the other teenager's
mother, and finally the other teenager would get the message and say, ‘What was the guy next
door trying to tell me?'</p>
<p>“We're trying to break all that down at Chrysler,” Greenwald explained while he was still at the
auto company. “If you are an operator in a plant and you need to tell someone three hundred feet
at the other end of the plant to change something so you can do your job better, go over and tell
him. Don't tell your foreman to tell your superintendent to tell his superintendent so that six
months from how the other person will still be trying to figure out what you wanted to change.”</p>
<p>More and more people, in businesses and elsewhere, are beginning to understand how
important good communication really is. The ability to communicate well is what lights the fire in
people. It's what turns great ideas into action. It's what makes all achievement possible.</p>
<p>Communicating well is not terribly complicated— not in theory, anyway. Communicating, after
all, is something every one of us does every day in our personal lives. We've all been
communicating since the early days of childhood. At least we think we have. But true
communication, effective communication, is in fact relatively rare in the adult world.</p>
<p>There's no secret recipe for learning to communicate well, but there are some basic concepts
that can be mastered with relative ease. Here are the first steps to successful communication.
Follow them and you will be on your way. <br>
1. Make communication a top priority. <br>
2. Be open to other people. <br>
3. Create a receptive environment for communication.</p>
<p>No matter how busy you find yourself during the work day, you absolutely must make time to
communicate. All the brilliant ideas in the world are worthless if you don't share them.
Communication can be accomplished in many ways—in meetings, in face-to-face sessions with
colleagues, just walking down the hall, or stopping at the water cooler, or spending half an hour in
the company lunchroom. What's most important is that communicating never stop.</p>
<p>Robert Crandall has a big conference room down the hall from his chairman's office at AMR
Corporation, the parent company of American Airlines. Every Monday he spends much of his day in
there, listening and talking to people from all parts of the company. “Yesterday morning,” Crandall
said not long ago, “we had the senior officers and eight or ten or twelve other people from three or
four levels in the company in there, and we were doing a very complicated analysis.</p>
<p>“We're trying to understand whether or not this hub-and-spoke system that we constructed has
become economically indefensible as a consequence of the way the industry is changing. When we
created this particular pattern of hubs and spokes, the world looked one way, and now it looks a
different way. That's had an effect on how passengers flow across the system. It's also had an effect
on pricing. The consequence is that we are not at all sure that the hub-and-spoke system remains
viable. Determining that is very complicated.</p>
<p>“It takes an enormous amount of data. So we spent three and a half hours yesterday, in the
course of which there were many different points of view expressed and a lot of talking back and
forth and a good deal of intense feeling all around. Anyway, we finally sent people away with three
or four supplementary assignments, and they'll come back in a couple of weeks with the additional
data. Then we'll sit down and talk some more. ‘Is what we are doing wrong? And what can we do
differently that has the probability of working?’ That's how we eventually hope to find our way out
of these dilemmas.”</p>
<p>The benefits here are twofold: Crandall gets the input of knowledgeable people and they get to
help create the future vision of American Airlines. That's fundamental to the development of
trusting relationships.</p>
<p>Communication doesn't have to happen in big conference rooms. Some of the best corporate
communication occurs in seemingly informal ways. Walter A. Green, the chairman of Harrison
Conference Services, Inc., uses a technique he calls his “one-on-ones.”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately,” Green says, “in organizations we have structures. We have a president, vice
presidents, and all these other levels. One-on-ones are a way of overcoming that. These are off-therecord
conversations—usually at lunch—where I meet with anyone in the organization I care to
meet with. It's a chance for me to stay in touch with what's important to them. How do they feel
about the company? How do they feel about their jobs? I'd like to learn something about them as
individuals. I like to become more human to them, and I like them to ask me questions about the
company. All of that is easier one-on-one.” As a result of these conversations, Green's vision for the
company begins to grow.</p>
<p>Douglas Warner, the J. P. Morgan president, has brought this practice of direct communication
into that old-line bank. “We literally walk around, walk through the inner floor,” Warner says. “Go
down and see some people. Get out of the office, go to other places instead of insisting that
everybody come here.”</p>
<p>Several times a week Warner or his top assistant has coffee with thirty or forty of Morgan's top
people. “Eyeball-to-eyeball communication, direct and informal,” in Warner's words. Even a bank
like Morgan has discovered the usefulness of these simple chats. The same theory is applied inside
the executive suite. “As part of all that, the managing directors of the firm, three hundred-odd
people, would be invited to a large room every day for lunch—the ones who are in New York and
the ones who are visiting from overseas. That way there's a real forum every day.”</p>
<p>David Luther, corporate director of quality at Corning, Incorporated, describes this process at his
organization: “I use the term bottom trawling, going to the bottom of the organization and asking,
What's really going on? What are people worried about? What are they saying? What are they up
against? What can you do to help?”</p>
<p>The need for effective communication doesn't stop at the office door. It extends to the home, to
the school, to the church, even to the halls of science. Any place where people meet with people,
communication is key.</p>
<p>It used to be that research scientists could spend their whole lives in the laboratory, singlemindedly
searching for the truths of the natural order. But those days are gone. In today's competitive world, even scientists need to listen and talk.</p>
<p>“Many scientists don't know how to effectively communicate what they are doing,” says Dr.
Ronald M. Evans, an eminent research professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. “They
know what they are doing. They have a pretty good idea of why they're doing it. But they have
difficulty putting that into perspective, transmitting the ideas outside the laboratory. It's a major
limitation at many levels. To obtain funding, you have to convince people that you're doing
something that's important.”</p>
<p>When Lee Iacocca first went to work at the Ford Motor Company, he discovered the same
limitation in many automobile designers and engineers: “I've known a lot of engineers with terrific
ideas who had trouble explaining them to other people. It's always a shame when a guy with great
talent can't tell the board or a committee what's in his head.”</p>
<p>Without mastery of that very basic human skill— the ability to talk and listen to others —
members of a company, a school, or a family can't thrive for long.</p>
<p>Things had gotten frenetic around the Levines’ house. The children were getting older. That
meant play dates, birthday parties, Little League games, gymnastics classes, Brownie troops,
religious instruction —and more carpool trips for Harriet than anyone could count.</p>
<p>Stuart had a job he loved, but the travel was grueling and it kept him away from the family more
than he would have liked. That left Harriet at home with Jesse and Elizabeth, who were terrific kids
but were getting more independent by the day.</p>
<p>“Jesse and Elizabeth were watching far too much television,” Harriet recalls, “and they weren't
reading nearly enough. We barely had time to communicate.”</p>
<p>Before things got really out of hand, the Levines all sat down together one night and came up
with a plan. They would form a family council, they decided. Every Sunday after dinner they would
gather around the kitchen table and talk in a calm way about whatever was on their minds. “The
idea was to have a regular forum for family communication, every week, no matter what,” Harriet
explains.</p>
<p>The family council began dealing with issues large and small. Are the kids getting in their half
hour of reading before television? Is Stuart going to be back in town for the soccer game? When is
Harriet going to stop serving that same chicken dish?</p>
<p>At the end of the meeting the children would be given their weekly allowances. “Everyone is
supposed to participate, and no one ever gets in trouble - as long as they tell the truth.” <br>
The biggest mistake managers used to make— besides thinking that all wisdom flowed from
them- was failing to understand that communication absolutely has to be a two-way street. You
have to share your ideas with others and listen to theirs. That's step number two: Be open to other
people—above, below, and beside.</p>
<p>Publilius Syrus, the Roman playwright, recognized this fact of human nature two thousand years
ago. “We are interested in others when they are interested in us,” Syrus wrote.
<br>
If you can show your colleagues you are receptive to their ideas, they're more likely to be
receptive to yours-and to keep you honestly informed about the things you need to know. Show
that you care about the future of the organization and that you care as much about them. And
don't limit those displays of concern to your coworkers. Communicate the same genuine caring to
your customers and your clients too.</p>
<p>At Saunders Karp & Company, merchant banker Thomas A. Saunders III spends his professional
life looking for growing companies to invest his clients’ funds in. He's an expert at spotting business
gems. Nothing impresses Saunders more than a company that really knows how to communicate
with its customers.</p>
<p>He recently paid a visit to a wholesale jewelry company in Lafayette, Louisiana. He spent a day
touring the company's facilities. But all it really took was five minutes in the telemarketing room for
Saunders to recognize a first-string communications success.</p>
<p>“They handled their customers very efficiently on the phone, and the quality of the service was
extremely high,” Saunders said. “They didn't seem to make any mistakes. It was just bing, bing,
bing, ‘You want this? .. . Yes, we have that in stock.... You want two of those, fine.... You want three
of those, fine. . . . Yes, we have them. . . . No, you have to back-order that.... May I suggest a
substitution? .. . Yes, well, if you look on page six hundred of our catalog, there's a mounting. . .’
Boom. ‘Thank you very much.’ It was over in fifteen seconds. Unbelievable.”</p>
<p>The average call took fifteen seconds, and the average customer went away thrilled. Who
wouldn't put money in a company like that? <br>
It's easy to become isolated from customers and colleagues, especially for those people who rise
in an organization. But no matter how high you get, communication still has to run in all directions,
talking and listening, up, down, and around the chain of command.</p>
<p>Ronald Reagan wasn't called the Great Communicator for nothing. Throughout his long political
career he made it a point to listen and talk to the people he served. Even when he was president,
Reagan continued to read constituent mail. He would have his White House secretaries give him a
selection of letters each afternoon. At night he would take them up to his quarters and write out
personal replies.</p>
<p>Bill Clinton has put the televised town meeting to much the same use: keeping himself informed
about how people are feeling and showing people that he cares about them. Even if he doesn't
have solutions for all the problems they bring up, there Clinton is, listening, connecting, articulating
his own ideas. There's nothing new about any of this. Abraham Lincoln took a similar approach
more than a century ago. In those days, any citizen could petition the president. Sometimes Lincoln
would ask an aide to respond, but frequently he would answer the petitioners personally.</p>

<p>He took some criticism for that. Why bother when there was a war to be fought, a union to be
saved? Because Lincoln knew that understanding public opinion was an essential part of being
president, and he wanted to hear it firsthand.</p>
<p>Richard L. Fenstermacher, executive director of North American auto operations marketing at
Ford Motor Company, is a firm believer in that. “My door's open,” he's constantly telling his people.
“If you're walking up the hall and you see me in there, even if you just want to say hi, stop in. If you
want to bounce an idea off me, do it. Don't feel you have to go through the managers.” <br>
That kind of easy interaction doesn't happen by accident. That's where rule number three comes
into play: Create a receptive environment for communication.</p>
<p>It's a basic fact about communicating with people: they won't say what they think—and won't
listen receptively to what you say—unless a foundation of genuine trust and shared interest has
been laid. You can't be insincere. How you really feel about communication, whether you're open
or not, comes through loud and clear, no matter what you say. “You know right away if somebody
is approachable or if they're not,” Olympic gymnast Mary Lou Retton has said. “When you get that
feeling, you can read a person by nonverbal communication and body language. You know when
somebody is standing in the corner and saying, ‘Hey, I don't want to be talked to.'”</p>
<p>How can you avoid sending that message? Be open, like people, and let them know you do.
Follow Retton's advice: “Being down-to-earth and humble is extremely important. I just try to put
people at ease. Everybody's the same. I think everybody is on a certain level, whether you are the
CEO of a company or a salesperson. It's just a different job.” That's what creating a receptive
environment is all about: putting people at ease.</p>
<p>It used to be easier than it is today. Television announcer and former baseball great Joe
Garagiola remembers how much one-on-one contact there used to be between the players and the
fans: “When we used to come off the field and go to our homes after the games, we would ride the
subways with the same fans who were in the stands a few hours earlier.</p>
<p>“It wasn't uncommon for one of the fans to say, ‘Hey, Joe, why did you swing at that third strike?
Why didn't you let it go?’ Now there isn't the same personal connection between the fan and the
players other than reading about whether or not he's signing a six- or a seven-million-dollar
contract.”</p>
<p>Ray Stata, the chairman of Analog Devices, Inc., a manufacturer of high-performance integrated
circuits, learned the importance of taking a personal interest from his friend Red Auerbach, the
long-time president of the Boston Celtics.</p>
<p>Stata recalls, “When he would talk about leadership, he often used the phrase, ‘I love my
people.’ He considered that a real prerequisite to leadership. And they have to know it. So if you
have an environment where people genuinely believe that at the end of the day they can trust in
your interest and concern about their well-being, then you have created relationships that have
more meaning to them.” Then, and only then, will the ground be appropriately prepared for
communication.</p>
<p>Don't expect this to happen without some work.</p>
<p>Several years ago Coming's David Luther was trying to convince a union leader to embrace the
quality-improvement program that the company was trying to start. Luther made his pitch, talking
on and on in what he thought was a very convincing way about the importance of quality
improvement. This program was going to improve life for both management and labor, Luther
promised the union man. But the labor leader clearly wasn't buying a word of what Luther had to
say.</p>
<p>Luther recalls, “He got up and he said, ‘Give me a break. That's baloney. You guys, that's a scam.
It's better than most of your scams, but it's a scam. All you're trying to do is get more out of the
workers here.'”</p>
<p>They kept talking, though. “He came around a little,” Luther says, “but I didn't convince him, and
I came to the conclusion that I could never talk my way into his trust. I could only demonstrate that
I deserved it. So I said, ‘I'm going to be back next year with this, and I'm going to be back the year
after that, and I'm going to be back the year after that. I'm going to keep coming back with the
same stuff.’” And Luther kept corning back.</p>
<p>His message took several years to sink in, and first he had to show he could be trusted on some
smaller issues. He had to show he was listening to their concerns as well. But in the end Luther had
the patience to let the message take hold, and Coming's unions became real partners in the
quality-improvement program.</p>
<p>One last thing to remember: Once people do take the risk of telling you what they think, don't
punish them for their openness. Do nothing —absolutely nothing— to discourage them from taking
the risk of communicating again.</p>
<p>“If an employee makes a suggestion that I don't agree with, then I have to be very delicate about
the way in which I tell them I don't agree,” says Fred J. Sievert, chief financial officer of the New
York Life Insurance Company. “I want to encourage them to come back to me the next time and
make another suggestion. Now, I told some of the people on my staff that I may disagree with them
ninety-nine times out of a hundred, but I want them to keep coming to me with their views. That's
what they get paid for. The one time out of a hundred is going to be of value, and I'm not going to
view them as any weaker because I disagree with them the other times.”</p>
<p>One in a hundred. That may not sound so impressive, but great fortunes have been made on
odds less certain than that. That's why listening and sharing ideas is so important.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that communication is both a skill and an art. It's a process worth
thinking about and practicing more than most people do. It sometimes involves showing personal
vulnerability by putting your ideas on the line. You're sharing with others and asking them to share
with you. That's not always easy. It takes work and time. Techniques have to be acquired and
practiced constantly. But take heart. Practice does make perfect, or very nearly so.</p>
<p>Kuo Chi-Zu is the chief prosecutor in Taipei, Taiwan, and a tremendously compelling public
speaker. But he wasn't always so comfortable talking in front of a group. As a rising young
prosecutor, Chi-Zu was always being invited to address local organizations. He said no to the
Rotary. He said no to the Lions. He said no to Junior Achievement. He was so frightened of the
prospect of appearing in public—as many people are—that he turned every invitation down.</p>
<p>“Even if I were just attending a meeting,” he remembers, “I always selected the seat at the far
corner. And I almost never said a single word.”</p>
<p>He knew this fear was slowing the progress of his career—not to mention keeping him awake at
night in fits of anxiety. He knew he had to get a grip on his communication problem.</p>
<p>Then one day Chi-Zu was invited to speak at his old high school, and he recognized at once that
this was his opportunity. He had, after all, made great effort over the years to maintain a strong
relationship with the school and with its students and graduates. If there was any audience he
could trust—and that would feel open to what he had to say—this was the one.</p>
<p>So he agreed to appear, and he prepared himself as well as he could. He chose a subject he knew
a tremendous amount about and cared deeply for: his job as a prosecutor. He built the speech
around real-life examples. He didn't memorize. He didn't write out the words. He just walked up to
the front of the school auditorium and spoke as if he were addressing a room full of friends, which
he was.</p>
<p>The speech was a great success. From the podium he could see the eyes in the audience riveted
on him. He could hear the people laughing at his jokes. He could feel their warmth and support,
and when he was finished speaking, the students rose to their feet for a robust standing ovation. <br>
Chi-Zu learned some valuable lessons about communication that day: how communication takes
a certain openness and a trusting environment, what dividends successful communication can pay.
Chi-Zu didn't stop there. He became a favorite on the Taipei lecture circuit and was quickly
catapulted into the chief prosecutor's job. <br>
He was finally learning to communicate.</p>
