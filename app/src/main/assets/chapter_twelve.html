<h2 align="center">FOCUS AND DISCIPLINE</h2><br>


<p><i>Back in 1933, David Burpee, famous seed man of Philadelphia, got the idea that the plain, everyday
stepchild of flowers could be made very beautiful and attractive. That stepchild was the marigold, a
forlorn but little waif with a most unfortunate trait: an unpleasant odor.</i></p>
<p><i>So David Burpee set out to develop a marigold that would titillate instead of shock the nostrils. He
knew there was just one way to do this, and that was to find what botanists call a mutation, an
individual flower, which by accident, doesn't have this unpleasant odor. So he sent all over the world
for marigold seed and got 640 separate cultures. He planted them and when they grew and
blossomed, he pushed his nose against them and sniffed. Every single one had a bad odor. Pretty
discouraging, but he kept searching, and finally a missionary in far-off Tibet sent him some seed of a
marigold that was odorless but had a scrawny flower.</i></p>
<p><i>marigold that was odorless but had a scrawny flower.
David Burpee crossed this with one of his large varieties and planted thirty-five acres. When they
were up and going strong, he called his foreman and gave an order that made the foreman think that
David Burpee had gone crazy. He told his foreman to get down on his hands and knees and smell
every plant in the thirty-five acres. If just one odorless plant with large flowers could be found, that
would be all that was needed. “It would take me thirty-five years to smell them all,” said the
foreman. So the employment agencies in that section were called up to be given an order like they
had never before received, an order for two hundred flower smellers.</i></p>
<p><i>These flower smellers came from everywhere and started to work. No one ever saw a crazier sight,
but Dave Burpee knew what he was doing. At last, one day, one of the flower smellers came loping
across the field to the foreman.</i></p>
<p><i>“I've got it,” he shouted. The foreman followed him to the place where the smeller had stuck down a
peg. Sure enough, there wasn't a hint of an unpleasant odor.</i><b>—DALE CARNEGIE</b></p>
<p>Margaret Thatcher led Britain through some of the most difficult years in the empire's history—a
time that included the Falklands War, a worldwide recession, and enough social upheaval to fill a
century or two. Those years wrecked any number of promising political careers, and as the prime
minister of Britain (not to mention the first woman ever to hold that job), Thatcher took more than
her share of the heat. Yet there was one thing people on all sides of British politics had to admit:
the Iron Lady never melted once. How did she manage such strength under pressure?</p>
<p>“If you lead a country like Britain,” Thatcher explained shortly after stepping down, “a strong
country, a country that has taken a lead in world affairs in good times and in bad, a country that is
always reliable, then you have to have a touch of iron about you.”</p>
<p>It's really not so complicated, the former prime minister said. Stay focused. Be self-disciplined.
Want desperately to succeed. “I do not know anyone who has got to the top without hard work,”
she went on. “That is the recipe. It will not always get you to the top, but it should get you pretty
near.”</p>
<p>Maggie Thatcher understood. Have a goal clearly in mind, something you really want; believe in
yourself and be persistent; and don't allow yourself to be distracted. In business, in family life, in
sports, in politics, follow these simple rules, and your chances of succeeding are astronomically
high Ivan Stewart was a man with a goal. He had a life-long dream of competing in long-distance
off-road auto racing— races of three hundred, five hundred, one thousand miles across rugged
terrain, involving hours and hours of intense concentration and intense backaches. But Stewart was
a general superintendent in the construction business with a wife, a mortgage, and three growing
kids. He had responsibilities. He had commitments. The odds were way against his reaching his
goal, but he also had a plan and lots of energy to pursue it.</p>
<p>“I wanted to be involved in racing, so I worked on the race cars after work and on Saturday and
Sunday. Then I got a chance to ride, just to be involved, never thinking at the time—not at all —
that it would ever get professional,” Stewart says.</p>
<p>One day his opportunity arrived. A driver Stewart had been working with broke his leg just
before a race. The car was ready and entered. He had no choice but to let Stewart drive.
So with his friend Earl Stahl sitting in the passenger seat, Stewart set out in the race. Everything
went to hell. They ran into an embankment. The car flipped over. They got stuck in the mud. The
other cars were whizzing by. His one chance of proving himself looked irretrievably lost.</p>
<p>“By now we're the last car,” he says, recalling that very first race. “Everybody's gone. They start
one car every thirty seconds, and there were probably sixty cars, seventy cars in that race.
Everybody's gone. Here's Earl and I, now we're last. We didn't go another ten miles, fifteen miles,
twenty miles, whatever it was, when the throttle —this is a Volkswagen-powered car—the cable
that goes from your foot back to the carburetor broke. So now I can't even drive. I said, ‘Earl, get a
crescent wrench.’ Earl gets the crescent wrench out of the tool box, and I pull out the wire that's
broken, and it's just long enough to pull around the crescent wrench so I can wrap it around the
crescent. We do this pretty quick. Within five or ten minutes we've got a hand throttle going so I
can push the throttle and I can push the clutch and I can drive one-handed. No power steering
though. This is determination—and I want to drive.</p>
<p>“I said to Earl, ‘I need you to shift it,’ because it's a four-speed transmission. ‘I'm going to give
you an elbow every time I want to change.’ So I'd push the throttle, and we were so messed up, I'd
have the clutch in, the throttle on, and he'd be in the wrong gear. Anyway, we got going pretty
good. I'd give the throttle and lay off the throttle. I'd push the clutch in and give him an elbow and
he'd give me a higher gear. Pretty soon he realized what we wanted to do. We were messed up
because once in a while he'd give me a low gear and I wanted a high gear and vice versa. But we got
pretty good at it. Pretty soon we started catching—this is a three-hundred-mile race. We catch one,
we catch another one. Teamwork. Yes, we got good at it. Pretty soon we were really driving. You
know, we were driving, and to make a long story short, we won that race. Won that three-hundredmile
race.” That kind of focus and self-discipline is what it takes to win the race in all parts of life.</p>
<p>Stewart went on to become the top off-road driver in America. He's won the prestigious
Valvoline oil Iron Man trophy—the sport's He is mann and Super Bowl rolled into one—so many
times that his fans now know him simply as Iron Man. And at forty-seven years old —ancient in this
body-jarring sport— Stewart signed another three-year sponsorship deal with Toyota.</p>
<p>“They know I'm getting older, and there's a lot of young kids coming in.” But that's just another
challenge, not a reason to give up. Who knows? Iron Man will probably still be racing at sixty. It's
that kind of focus—whatever the field of endeavor—that separates the achievers from the no
achievers.</p>
<p>That's the single biggest secret to raising major money, says Thomas A. Saunders III at Saunders
Karp & Company.</p>
<p>“When I was raising this big fund a few years ago for Morgan Stanley,” Saunders recalls, “we had
an assignment to go in and raise for our merchant banking business two hundred million dollars.
We raised two-point-three billion. It was the second-largest amount of money that's ever been
assembled for a pure equity fund. I think an awful lot of the success of that was just stick-toitiveness,
not being prepared to go in and be turned off. Not being prepared to accept no for an
answer, a willingness to come back at it again. A willingness to keep pushing. A willingness to find
out why someone said no—and maybe convince the person to say yes.”</p>
<p>Fred Sievert is chief financial officer at New York Life Insurance Company. The person he learned
his perseverance from was his father, whose name is also Fred. “The one love in his life was playing
the trumpet,” Sievert says of his father. “He played with some of the best big bands, including Harry
James, Artie Shaw, and Jack Teagarden. He's a very exceptional trumpet player.”</p>
<p>And even the father never stopped practicing the basics. “He would play scales,” the son says.
“Here's a guy who's already one of the best trumpet players in the country, and what's he doing?
He's not playing some lengthy new tune that he wants to learn. He's playing the scales. Hour after
hour, day after day. He would play these different scales. He would say to me that if he knew the
scales and he could play them quickly, he could learn any song there was.”</p>
<p>That same unshakable focus is what propelled two Southern governors, sixteen years apart, all
the way to the White House. One was a soft-spoken peanut farmer from Georgia by the name of
Jimmy Carter. The other came from a little dot on the map called Hope, Arkansas. His name is Bill
Clinton.</p>
<p>That same unshakable focus is what propelled two Southern governors, sixteen years apart, all
the way to the White House. One was a soft-spoken peanut farmer from Georgia by the name of
Jimmy Carter. The other came from a little dot on the map called Hope, Arkansas. His name is Bill
Clinton.</p>
<p>When Clinton ran in 1992, he was thought to face similarly long odds—and the reasons were
mostly the same. He was a little better known than Carter had been, but not much so, and the
sitting Republican president had just won a hugely popular war.</p>
<p>If you believed the early experts, neither one of these governors had much of a chance. By the
end of the early primaries, these two sons of Dixie were supposed to be out of the running. That's
not what happened, of course, and there are many reasons why. None of them was more
important than the focus and the discipline of these two campaigns.</p>
<p>In the course of these grueling races, both men had many reasons to give up. For Carter, besides
his utter obscurity, there was the threat of Ted Kennedy and the nagging perception that Kennedy,
not Carter, was the choice of “real Democrats.” For Clinton, there were the claims of Gennifer
Flowers, the count-him-out editorials, the power of a sitting president, and a fellow named Perot.
Those odds didn't stop Carter in 1976. They didn't stop Clinton in 1992. And the biggest reason
both times was that both men were focused. They knew exactly what they wanted to achieve. They
were working toward a specific goal, a dream each man had held since childhood. As a result, they
had superhuman motivation. They worked like crazy and kept their eyes on the ball, and they won
the prize.</p>
<p>Persistence is the other part of the equation. To get what you want in life, you've got to believe
in yourself and you've got to be willing to keep after it. Try again and again and again.</p>
<p>Burt Manning of J. Walter Thompson, one of the world's largest advertising agencies, started in
the business as a copywriter. He became the only “creative person” ever to head the company,
which has produced campaigns for such major clients as Ford, Lever Brothers, Nestle, Kellogg,
Kodak, Goodyear, and Warner-Lambert.</p>
<p>Yes, talent and creativity are vital in a business as competitive as advertising, but without hard,
well-focused, and persistent work, all that talent and creativity can come to naught. It's a lesson
Manning learned firsthand, early in his career.</p>
<p>He came up with what he thought was a great campaign for his first big client. The client was
Schlitz and the slogan Manning was urging was one that would become as famous as “Mmm-mmm
good": “When you're out of Schlitz, you're out of beer.” Manning was high on the campaign, but
hard as this is to believe today, the Schlitz Brewing Company was not. The Schlitz people
considered the whole idea too negative. They wanted Manning to come up with something more
upbeat.</p>
<p>Manning wasn't about to give up. He went back to the customer again and again, presenting the
campaign a total of six times. He recalls the final reaction: “I was able to bring it back so many
times essentially because I had a relationship with this client that permitted me to and didn't make
him throw me out of the room. On the sixth time he said, ‘All right. I don't really think this is right,
but if you guys do, test it somewhere.'</p>
<p>The rest, of course is advertising history. Manning's talent and creativity dreamed up a first-rate
campaign, but only his hard work and persistence delivered it to the public. Dale Carnegie
articulated the principle. “Patience and perseverance,” he said, “will accomplish more in this world
than a brilliant dash. Remember that when something goes wrong.</p>
<p>“Don't let anything discourage you,” he wrote. “Keep on. Never give up. That had been the policy
of most of those who have succeeded. Of course, discouragement will come. The important thing is
to surmount it. If you can do that, the world is yours.”</p>
<p>What this means, in practical terms, is that you've got to remember what the basic goal is —
whether it's selling an ad campaign, winning an auto race, or getting elected to the presidency of
the United States. Then work single-mindedly toward that goal.</p>
<p>And be sure to follow through. That's not always easy. You have to train yourself to march
through every step, to complete every detail of every job every time. That's what makes people
more valuable to a company, more crucial to an organization, more trustworthy to their colleagues
and friends—following through on every detail.</p>
<p>“When I walk into an office and I see a stack of return calls to be made —you know, a big stack —
I think to myself, ‘This guy's out of control,'” says E. Martin Gibson, chief executive officer of
Corning Lab Services, Inc. “That raises a little question about your dependability, if you don't even
return your calls. It's little things.”</p>
<p>People who prove themselves dependable are given greater opportunities to show how
dependable they can really be. “People know they can depend on you,” Gibson says. “They ask you
to do something, and they don't make a follow-up note. They know you'll do it. That's
dependability. Don't be one of these flaky characters who doesn't return phone calls, who gets a
memo from the chairman and doesn't know quite how to answer it and sticks it aside and forgets
about it. The chairman's up there wondering, What is wrong with this bozo?”</p>
<p>It is in those disciplined details —hundreds and thousands of little details —that success or
failure is found every day. “It's old values, like getting to an appointment early, remembering to
follow through on your promises, and having pride in your work,” says Joyce Harvey of Harmon
Associates Corporation. “If you're doing a letter of credit, you've got to follow steps one to four.
You can't skip step three. Mistakes are costly. Don't move too fast. Check your details, and stay
focused.”</p>
<p>Ross Greenburg discovered the importance of discipline and concentration that night in 1990
when Mike Tyson was knocked out by Buster Douglas. Tyson was at that point the undisputed
heavyweight champion of the world. Douglas was a tough fighter, but up to the opening bell, he
wasn't given much of a shot.</p>
<p>Greenburg is executive producer of HBO Sports. By the time of the Tyson-Douglas match, he had
already produced more than one hundred title fights for television. But even for a veteran like
Greenburg, concentration can sometimes be shaken by dramatic events.</p>
<p>As Greenburg recalls, “In about the second round, it was obvious that something was right with
Douglas and very wrong with Tyson. Tyson had eaten three or four straight jabs and my announcers
and I immediately pounced on the story line.” So far, so good.</p>

<p>“In the fourth round, Douglas threw a combination that rocked Tyson, and there was a loud
scream on our communication line. Everyone in our truck started realizing what we were seeing in
front of us. For one of the very rare times, we were getting caught up in the sporting event rather
than in our individual jobs. I can remember it vividly, and all the people that work with me will tell
you the same story. When I sensed this, I said, ‘Okay, everybody relax. Let's remember we have a
job to do here. If you let yourself become too tied to the event, you'll lose sight of the work at
hand.’ That's all it took. Immediately everybody was cut off from that basic, visceral reaction to the
event, and we worked our way back into the job—providing replays of the staggering
combinations.”</p>
<p>There just isn't much room for slipups on live TV. “See, if I get caught up in rooting for Douglas at
that point, I won't be able to cue up my tape machines and my ads. My associate directors won't be
able to cue those points so you will see that replay when the round is over, which is our job.”</p>
<p>But Greenburg admits that even he came close to losing his focus on that memorable night. “I
will never, ever forget—I will never, ever forget—the moment that Tyson hit the canvas. It was as if
I were reading some historical account of heavyweight championship boxing and at that split
second, I saw the page turn and I was going to the new chapter and the new heavyweight
champion. I'll take that to my grave. Tyson-Douglas, and maybe there will be another event down
the line. I'll just be able to say, ‘I was part of that.’” Steely focus isn't important just in sports
television. In the case of Dr. Scott Coyne, this same kind of focus and discipline literally made the
difference between life and death.</p>
<p>Coyne, a radiologist who had once studied for the priesthood, was the first doctor on the scene
when an Avianca Boeing 727 crashed near his home on Long Island one wretched January night. For
more than an hour Coyne was the only doctor on the scene.</p>
<p>One by one he had to tend to the passengers’ injuries. He also had to soothe their nerves. He
had to do it all in just a minute or two with each person on the ground, and he had to do it
without language, since most of the people on the plane were from Colombia and didn't speak any
English. Coyne's Spanish didn't go much beyond “Doc-tor, doc-tor. “He made himself understood by
focusing every fiber of his being, Coyne said. He found a way to make this work.</p>
<p>“I had a stethoscope on,” he says, remembering that crazy night. “I kept saying, ‘Doc-tor,’ and
some of them were crying and screaming. You don't know if they're screaming because they're
scared or because they're broken apart. I was able to communicate by touching the faces. You
could tell how bad they'd been hurt by how they looked at you.</p>
<p>“I had to whisper in their ears. I had to maintain my composure and hold them and try to
reassure them just by my expression and by my touch and holding their faces. I was unable to get a
history from anybody. You know, you can't ask them where they're hurting: How bad does it hurt?
Does the back hurt? I had to literally check every patient from head to toe, and then as I went
down the row, I'd find these fractures were just grotesque. I'd never seen fractures like this. Legs
were literally hanging off. And you check these fractures and start IVs the best you can, and you go
to the next patient and start all over and check the rib cage—by hand. They couldn't tell you. You
couldn't even say, ‘Point,’ so they could understand what you're saying. Well, it was a surreal
experience because when you're going through it, the adrenaline is so high.” Focus. Intense one
hundred percent focus. That's what got Coyne through.</p>
<p>Coyne's focus was so intense that everything peripheral was just blocked out of his mind. He
discovered just how focused he had been later when he spoke about the accident at a stressmanagement
seminar. The others in the group were describing all the mayhem you'd expect in that
kind of circumstance: ambulances and fire trucks and squawking radios and screaming survivors
and rescue workers yelling back and forth. Coyne heard none of it.</p>
<p>“What I remember is how quiet it was. It all seemed so quiet and orderly. I didn't hear anything.
You had to focus so much you didn't hear. It was like a trance. All I remember is just walking in
utter silence. I never heard a thing. The only thing I did hear was helicopters about an hour later.
Helicopters came in to evacuate some of the injured people.” Focus, the ability to ignore
distractions and pursue only what is important—that's what made the difference that night and
helped save all those lives.</p>

<h2 align="center">LEADERS NEVER LOSE THEIR FOCUS. THEY KEEP THEIR EYES ON THE BIG PICTURE.</h2><br>
