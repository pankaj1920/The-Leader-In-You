<h2 align="center">SEEING THINGS FROM THEOTHER PERSON'SPOINT OF
VIEW</h2><br>
<p>I wanted a private secretary last year, and I put an ad in the paper under a box number. I bet I got
three hundred replies. Almost all of them began something like this: “This is in reply to your ad in
Sunday's Times under Box 299. I wish to apply far the position you offer. I am twenty-six years old,
etc. ...”</p>
<p>But one woman was smart. She didn't talk about what she wanted. She talked about what I wanted.
Her letter read like this: “Dear Sir: You will probably get two or three hundred letters in reply to your
ad. You are a busy man. You haven't time to read all of them. So if you will just reach for your
telephone right now and call Vanderbilt 3-9512,” or whatever it was, “I'll be glad to come over and
open the letters and throw the worthless ones in the wastebasket and place the others on your desk
for your attention. I have had fifteen years experience…”</p>
<p>She then went on to tell about the important men she had worked for. The moment I got that letter, I
felt like dancing on the table. 1 immediately picked up the telephone and told her to come over, but I
was too late. Some other employer had grabbed her. A woman like that has the business world at her
feet. <b>— DALECARNEGIE</b></p>
<p>Long before ad man Burt Manning ever set foot on Madison Avenue, he wanted to be a writer. Not
a copywriter, an author. So young Manning slaved over a typewriter every day, producing short
stories and novels and what he was sure were gut-wrenching plays. But like most young writers,
Manning couldn't come close to supporting himself with his words. He needed a job to pay the
bills.</p>
<p>Door-to-door selling was the best idea he could find.</p>
<p>He sold Encyclopedia Britannica's. He sold high-end kitchenware. He even went door-to-door in
the old working-class neighborhoods of his native Chicago, selling cemetery property.</p>
<p>That last product turned out to be the most profitable of all—but not at first. It wasn't for lack of
trying. Every evening after a full day at the typewriter, Manning put on a suit and tie. He packed his
salesman's case. And he pressed his most enthusiastic cemetery pitch on the people who answered
his knocks: how cemetery property offered strong investment advantages, how Chicago's rapid
population growth would surely produce a scarcity of cemetery property, how his company's fiveyear
buy-back guarantee made this a no-risk deal.</p>
<p>“It was actually a very good, low-cost investment, and I believed in it. But I couldn't sell a thing. I
wasn't coming at it from their point of view. Instead of focusing on their most important concerns, I
kept focusing on the financial aspects. But with the product I was selling, there was something
much more relevant that I hadn't thought about.”</p>
<p>Manning had failed to ask himself the most basic questions. “I had to say, ‘What's really of
concern to these folks? What separates them in their views from other people I might know? What
do I have to offer that will make them feel good about themselves and feel good about what they
are doing for their families?’” The process, as far as Hayes is concerned, begins before a potential
customer even steps inside a Lerner store. “In some malls we have seventy-foot lease fronts,” she
said. “The customer, within eight-point-five seconds, is going to decide whether to walk into that
store or just go past it.” That instant decision, multiplied millions of times, will determine in large
measure whether Lerner is a success. Or as Hayes looks at it, “I've got eight-point-five seconds.”</p>
<p>The highly competitive retailing industry has really been the leader in seeing the world from the
customer's point of view.</p>
<p>We've all been inside a poorly run store. All the clerks are huddled together, talking to each
other. An approaching customer feels like an intruder in some private club. Service? You want
service? The sales clerks are far too bored, far too annoyed, or far too busy to be interrupted for
something like that.</p>
<p>The era of apathetic customer service has finally begun to pass. Customers said enough. Stores
that don't adapt to the new customer-is-everything ethic tend now to go out of business fast,
taking their aloof employees with them.</p>
<p>The late Sam Walton hired full-time “greeters” for his Wal-Mart discount stores, people whose
sole job was to stand near the front door, say hello to customers, and point them in the right
direction. Why? It wasn't just Walton's Arkansas hospitality. He had enough sense to see his own
business as the customers do. Here they are, stepping into this huge, brightly lit store, with aisle
after aisle of merchandise and no idea which way to go. People need guidance. They appreciate the
store that provides it. And if they can locate the merchandise that they're looking for, they are
more likely to buy it. That'll delight the customers, which will be good for the store. A delighted
customer is good for any store.</p>
<p>“Exceed your customers’ expectations.” That was always one of Sam Walton's rules. “If you do,
they'll come back over and over. Give them what they want and a little more.” At retailing's upper
end, the Nordstrom chain managed to sail through the recession of the late 1980s and the early
1990s. The department store's number-one priority: see things the customer's way.</p>
<p>“Nordstrom is the most feared retailer in the world,” says business consultant Denis E. Waitley.
“My wife, Susan, has discovered them as her greatest ally. She bought two pairs of Nordstrom
shoes and took them back after she wore them for two weeks. One of the pair hurt, and they took
them both back. No problem. Can do. The customer is always king and queen. Customers are
royalty, treated the way we want to be treated. That's the way it works.”</p>
<p>Even so, Waitley wasn't prepared for the early evening phone call he got at home one night. A
friendly-sounding woman was on the line.</p>
<p>She: “Hello, may I speak to Susan Waitley, please? This is Martha, your Nordstrom customerservice
representative.”</p>
<p>He: “Martha, you're a commissioned sales rep trying to make extra points. What do you want?
I'm getting ready to eat, and I don't allow interruptions during dinner. What is it you want Susan
for?”</p>
<p>She: “The shoes came in at the store in Susan's size and color, and I'm delivering them after
work.”</p>
<p>He: “As I remember, you live in South County. We're in North County, which is out of your way.
I'll be eating in five minutes, which won't allow you enough time to come by. But thank you for
trying.”</p>
<p>She: “I'm calling from my cellular phone in your driveway.”</p>
<p>He: “Oh, come or in:”</p>
<p>So Nordstrom made a sale, and even Waitley had to admit he was impressed. The store was
looking at things in terms of the customer's interests.</p>
<p>It isn't How can we do business in a manner most convenient to us? It is How can we do business
in the waymost convenient to you? Delighting the customer—that's what it's all about. And there's
no way to make all those judgments without looking through the potential customer's eyes.</p>
<p>For every product it sells, Dun & Bradstreet Software Services, Inc., creates a “customer council.”
“We do not build a product until the customer council has instructed us that this is their
priority,” explains John Imlay, the company's chairman. “They come with a priority list. We come
with one, the features and functions. We want to be competitive and they want to satisfy their
needs. They give us input and we take pride in solving their problems and satisfying their needs.”</p>
<p>This is not considered a luxury at Dun & Brad-street. It's a basic part of doing business. “We
could not develop a product without customer input,” Imlay declares. “There would be an ivory
tower, and then we'd be no good.”</p>
<p>This outward-looking perspective shouldn't be reserved only for customers. It applies as well to
employees, to suppliers, to anyone else you come into contact with every day.</p>
<p>David Holman runs the export division of John Holman & Co. Pty. Ltd., an Australian produce
vendor. One day Holman had the unhappy task of calling up one of his biggest growers with a piece
of terrible news: the new export price for the man's vegetables was going to be half what was
originally expected.</p>
<p>This generated the predictable reaction on the phone. The man sounded aghast. The situation
seemed serious enough that Holman decided to drive the two hours to the man's farm and finish
the discussion in person.</p>
<p>When he got to the farm, the fields were wet and muddy, and the grower was out with the crop.
So Holman borrowed a spare pair of the grower's rubber boots and marched out to meet him in
the field.</p>
<p>“How are you doing?” Holman asked the grower in a concerned tone of voice. Then he listened
with true empathy about all the hard work the grower had put in, about the time that had gone
into this year's crop, about the economic hardship of being on the land in the 1990s, about his
disappointment over the current price.</p>
<p>Holman had no trouble understanding the grower's point of view. The grower clearly had major
problems on his hands. Holman just expressed a warm personal concern. That was enough. Much
to Holman's surprise, without his even mentioning the price he had offered or talking about the
purchase of the crop, the grower said, “I can see you are being genuine with me, and you
understand my position. I will accept your offer in the hope that things will improve soon for us
both.”</p>

<p>So get into the other person's boots. There's no better way to ease a difficult situation.</p>
<p>“We have a little carpet venture in China,” says Adriana Bitter, president of Scalamandre Silks.
“On the day of the Tiananmen Square massacre, when nothing was operating for big business, our
little mill was. That day we sent off a telegram, saying we were terribly sorry they were suffering.
We never mentioned the giant order that had to be delivered to England the following week. We
thought, ‘No way. Nothing's getting out.’ But we received an answer, ‘Thank you for your telegram.
Your order was shipped this morning.’ I don't know how they got it out of China, but they did. We
have a good rapport with this little mill out in the mountains.”</p>
<p>By seeing things from the mill workers’ point of view, Bitter made sure the impossible order
arrived.</p>
<p>This obsessive attention to customer service is a life-or-death issue in every business. At Harrison
Conference Services, Inc., if it means making the facilities more comfortable for women or serving a
more healthful menu, no problem. Can do.</p>
<p>And it's not enough just to wait around for the suggestion box to fill up or the complaint letters
to arrive in the mail. It's vital to stay one step ahead of the customers. Smart business leaders are
always thinking about what the customer will want next—a few days, a few weeks, a few months
from now. This is all part of thinking in terms of the other person's interests, a reversal of What's in
it for me?</p>
<p>There's certainly no shortage of business publications being sold today—magazines, books,
newsletters, on-line data services, fax reports—but the vast majority of these publications, Martin
Edelston believed, were not delivering the practical information that many business people craved.
“They're devoted to business news, more or less. But they don't tell you, in practical terms, how to
deal with your employees, how to cut health costs. They'll talk about the healthcare problem, but
they won't tell you how to dig into it.” So Edelston started a company, Boardroom Reports, to fill
that void.</p>
<p>Does it take a genius to dream up this stuff? Hardly. It takes leaders who are asking themselves
day in and day out, “How does the customer rate our business? What will the customer want
next?”</p>
<p>Just about every business can benefit from looking at the world this way.
“Last year,” says SAS Airlines president Jan Carlzon, “each of our ten million customers came in
contact with approximately five SAS employees. This contact lasted an average of fifteen seconds.
These fifty million moments of truth are moments that ultimately determine whether SAS will
succeed.”</p>
<p>Looking at things from the other person's perspective doesn't happen on its own. The questions
aren't complicated, but they have to be asked. Ask them at work, at home, in the social scene.
You'll soon be seeing things as others do.</p>
<p>What life experiences does the other person bring to this interaction? What is the other person
trying to achieve here? What is the other person trying to avoid? What other constituencies does
the other person have to serve? What will it take for the other person to consider this encounter a
success? The answers to these various questions will be different at different companies, although
some themes will no doubt recur. But whatever the precise answers, the point here isn't simply to
go along with everything the other person wants. It is to make a genuine, sincere effort to figure
out what the other person is really looking for—and as much as is humanly possible, to deliver
that. As Dale Carnegie said, “If you can help people solve their problems, the world is your oyster.”</p>
<p>It took an angry complaint letter to remind Corning's David Luther that his idea of great isn't
necessarily the customer's idea of great. Luther was working in Britain in those days. Corning had
sent around a comprehensive customer survey, and this one respondent did not mince words.
“Corning stinks,” he wrote.</p>
<p>As any good executive would, Luther followed up on the complaint and invited the man in for a
chat. “Well, why does Coming stink?” Luther asked the man, who worked in a warehouse that was
stocked with Corning products.</p>
<p>“It's your labels,” the man said.</p>
<p>“Ah, I got you,” Luther said, brightening up. “You've got to be confusing us with somebody else.
Our labels are printed by computer. They show the source of manufacturing, the country of origin,
your code, our code, the date, everything you want to know.”</p>
<p>The man shook his head slowly back and forth. “Son,” he asked, “have you ever been in a
warehouse?”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah,” Luther answered. “I spent ten years in a warehouse, as a matter of fact.”</p>
<p>“Have you ever been to my warehouse?” Luther admitted he hadn't. “Come with me,” the man
told him. So the two of them marched directly to the warehouse. The tiers in this particular
warehouse were higher than those Luther was used to back home. The upper tiers, in fact, were
way up above Luther's head.</p>
<p>The warehouse man directed his attention to one of the top shelves. “We put Corning stuff up
there,” the man said. “But can you read the labels up there?”</p>
<p>“No,” Luther had to admit. “I can't, as a matter of fact.” “That's the point,” the warehouse man
told him.“Can't see it.” So that's what he meant by “Corning stinks.” Luther learned a valuable
lesson that day. “You've got to get inside the customer's organization,” he said. “Think about the
person in the warehouse. He's got requirements. She's got requirements.” And you won't find out
about them unless you bother to ask.</p>
<p>If you want to have more successful relationships with your customers, your family, and your
friends, look at things from the other person's perspective.</p>
